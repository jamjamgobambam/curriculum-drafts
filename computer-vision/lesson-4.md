We are going to build upon our knowledge about pixels in order to envision how we might use filters to change the values stored within pixels in order to make the information more useful for computer vision applications.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

There will be many different responses to this question. Use what you overheard when circulating the classroom to prime possible responses if the discussion becomes too focused on one type of filter. Possible filter ideas include:<br>Beauty Filter – smoothes one’s face, giving a more youthful appearance<br>Vintage Filter - uses sepia or other tones to make the image seem older<br>Funny Face Filter - distorts a face that is detected in an image in a variety of ways<br>Dance Light Filter - A filter that uses lighting and flashes inspired by one’s hands<br>Animal Filter - Overlays a person in the image / video with some type of trait from an animal<br>Artistic Filter - Changes an image into an interpretation of a classic or neo art style.<br><br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> The main goal with the conversation is to activate prior knowledge from students and to get them thinking about filters that they already know in practice.<br><br>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> “How long does it take to process?”<br><br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Many filters these days are very quick! It may appear as though the filter is instant. However, other more complex filters might have a brief delay before the image is rendered completely. Students might point out that the size of the image affects how long it takes to process – the bigger the image, the slower the processing. It might also depend on the device that is used. Chromebooks, iPads, phones, and MacBook Pros all have different speeds that they can process information. Students might also point out that processing a video takes longer than an image since each frame of a video is essentially an image in and of itself.<br><br>🎙Remarks<br>Just like we have our own favorite filters, image detection applications have their own filters that they prefer as well. Today, we are going to take a look at one of the more common filters: edge detection.<br></p> |

They should put each step of their algorithm on its own post-it note. Students should be encouraged to add sticky notes as ideas pop up, remove sticky notes that no longer seem applicable, and move them around as the steps and process evolve.<br><br>🔁 <strong>Circulate:</strong> Spend some time with each group listening to their conversations and seeing the algorithms that develop. Encourage the students to use the Algorithm Hint Cards that you set up if they appear stuck in their thinking or need a nudge to crystallize a concept.<br><br>Teaching Tip<br>For the hint cards, you might consider taping them backwards and upside-down to a whiteboard or at the front of the room. That way, students can come up and flip the hint that they need. The back should be numbered 1 through 4 to let them know the order with which they should flip the cards. The hints are scaffolded in such a way as to gradually release more and more pertinent and directive advice as they are revealed.<br><br>There are two different sets of Hint Cards (algorithm and efficiency) for the two steps in this activity. Make sure that students know which one is which!<br><br>If you do not have access to different colored sticky notes, possible revisions of the activity include:<br>Use a singular color sticky, but put the heading “Algorithm” at the top the sticky notes used in this first part.<br>You might use cut up strips of paper as well to accomplish the same task.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Some of the more important ones to discuss and point out are as follows:<br>Looking for Changes in Brightness– edges are often delineated visually, and examining the underlying brightness of pixels might be important<br>From this discussion point, students might ponder which color they should investigate since there are red, green, and blue values in each pixel. This is a good point and we will circle back around to this when students look to revise their algorithms.<br>Students might also point out that differences in brightness might occur horizontally or vertically.<br>Set a threshold value– if a pixel’s value is below (or above) the threshold value, then it is discarded. In this way, we can begin to segment or slice up an image. Finding a good threshold value might be a challenge.<br>Use a grid to overlay the image so that you are focused on a small space at a time<br><br>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> What are some of the challenges that remain?<br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Students might point out that there seems to be a lot of computations that are happening, but they are unclear what those are (This is to be expected!). Students might bring up the fact that some images have lots of noise in them, especially older or low light images, and it might be hard to find distinct edges when looking for differences in brightness.<br><br>🎙Remarks<br>Another challenge that remains for us is how we deal with lots of large images. The bigger the image, the more processing power it will take to compute our algorithms. Let’s think about that point for a moment…<br></p>                                                       |

This greatly boosts performance of filtering algorithms.<br>Reduce the color values - we learned that all pixels contain at least a red, green, and blue value (some also include an alpha, or transparency value). We can average the three values together to form one number which will display as grayscale (0 - black / 255 - white / all other values - shades of gray).<br><br>💬 <strong>Discuss:</strong> To increase the processing speed of your algorithm, was there a compromise that needed to be made elsewhere?<br><br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> An important point here is that introducing efficiencies often means reducing the fidelity of the image in some way. In the two examples referenced above, sampling an image permanently gets rid of lots of pixels within an image, and while we can infer what those might be, it is impossible to recover that data. This is similar to working with color. When we convert an image to grayscale, we lose the unique color values that are present in the pixels.<br><br>🎙Remarks<br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

An edge detection algorithm does not require a full color, high resolution image in order to process. Quite the opposite!<br><br>Teaching Tip<br>If you would like to model what sampling looks like for the class, this widget will allow you to load an image and adjust the sample size in pixels. The result is a downscaled image that would process much faster than the full image. In this widget, we zoom in on the downscaled image so that the individual pixels are easily seen rather than simply showing a smaller version.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
