## Stage 1 -- Desired Results

### Established Goals



{% hint style="info" %}
What relevant goals (e.g., content standards, course or program objectives, learning outcomes) will this design address?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Big Ideas are often implied and sometimes stated in goals or content standards. Look for key concepts. Consider the ideas in key nouns.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Design Checklist</strong></summary>

* [ ] Only those goals or content standards that are directly relevant to the unit and assessed in Stage 2 are listed.

</details>

### Understandings

_Students will understand that . . ._

*

{% hint style="info" %}
What are the big ideas? What specific understandings about them are desired? What misunderstandings are predictable?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Big Ideas are explicitly highlighted here.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Design Checklist</strong></summary>

* [ ] Derive from or are aligned with appropriate goals (e.g., content standards or curriculum objectives).
* [ ] Are both overarching (to promote transfer of big ideas) and topical (specific enough to focus teaching, learning, and assessment).
* [ ] Are framed as full-sentence generalizations in response to the stem: "The student will understand that . . . "
* [ ] Are not obvious or true by definition (i.e., factual knowledge). They need to be uncovered (rather than merely stated) for students to come to understand them.

</details>

### Essential Questions



{% hint style="info" %}
What provocative questions will foster inquiry, understanding, and transfer of learning?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Big Ideas are explicitly highlighted here.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Design Checklist</strong></summary>

* [ ] Clarify the big ideas and connect to other topics and contexts, while topical essential questions frame and guide inquiry into the topic.
* [ ] Are thought provoking and arguable, rather than "leading" questions that point to the facts.
* [ ] As needed, are framed in appropriate "kid language" to make them accessible to students.

</details>

### Knowledge

_Students will know . . ._

*

{% hint style="info" %}
What key knowledge will students acquire as a result of this unit?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Big Ideas are implied here. Consider the larger ideas that connect the facts and the larger purposes for mastering the skill.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Design Checklist</strong></summary>

* [ ] Key knowledge and skills, needed to meet the standards and enable the desired understandings, are identified.

</details>

### Skills

_Students will be able to . . ._

*

{% hint style="info" %}
What should they eventually be able to do as a result of such knowledge and skill?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Big Ideas are implied here. Consider the larger ideas that connect the facts and the larger purposes for mastering the skill.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Design Checklist</summary>

* [ ] Key knowledge and skills, needed to meet the standards and enable the desired understandings, are identified.

## Stage 2 -- Assessment Evidence

### Performance Tasks

#### Performance Task Title

task summary in GRASPS form

{% content-ref url="pt-1-title-blueprint.md" %}
[pt-1-title-blueprint.md](pt-1-title-blueprint.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Performance Task Title

task summary in GRASPS form

{% content-ref url="pt-2-title-blueprint.md" %}
[pt-2-title-blueprint.md](pt-2-title-blueprint.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Through what authentic performance tasks will students demonstrate the desired understandings? By what criteria will performances of understanding be judged?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** A constant focus on and effective use of Big Ideas should be at the heart of performance tasks (as reflected in task guidelines and rubrics).
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Design Checklist</summary>

* [ ] The performance tasks are aligned with one or more desired results in Stage 1. The tasks will yield appropriate evidence of the identified understandings.
* [ ] The tasks involve a complex, real-world (authentic) application of the identified knowledge, skill, and understandings.
* [ ] The tasks are written in GRASPS form.
* [ ] The tasks allow students to demonstrate understanding with some choice, option, or variety in the performances and products.
* [ ] The tasks are not likely to be performed well without a clear grasp of the understandings the task is meant to assess.
* [ ] The tasks require one or more of the [six facets of understanding](https://app.gitbook.com/o/V16NNqCBFCgpOHXV7pCL/s/qRQCb3peZ9sYMzD73AKg/course-structure/backwards-design/facets-of-understanding).
* [ ] The scoring rubric includes distinct traits of understanding and successful performance.
* [ ] The scoring rubric highlights what is appropriate, given the evidence needs suggested by the Desired Results of Stage 1.

</details>

### Other Evidence



{% hint style="info" %}
Through what other evidence (e.g., quizzes, tests, academic prompts, observations, journals) will students demonstrate achievement of the desired results?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** Quizzes, tests, and prompts should relate to the Big Ideas (e.g., oral or written questions on one or more of the Essential Questions).
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Design Checklist</summary>

* [ ] Other appropriate evidence has been identified in summary form (e.g., key quizzes, exams, student self-assessments) to supplement the evidence provided by the performance tasks.

</details>

### Student Self-Assessment and Reflection



{% hint style="info" %}
How will students reflect upon and self-assess their learning?
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Design Checklist</summary>

* [ ] Students are given the opportunity to self-assess and reflect upon their learning and performance.

</details>

## Stage 3 -- Learning Plan

{% hint style="info" %}
What learning experiences and instruction will enable students to achieve the desired results? How will the design

* **W** - Help students know **where** the unit is going and **what** is expected? Help the teacher know **where** the students are coming from (prior knowledge, interests)?
* **H** - **Hook** all students and **hold** their interest?
* **E** - **Equip** students, help them **experience** the key ideas, and **explore** the issues?
* **R** - Provide opportunities to **rethink** and **revise** their understanding and work?
* **E** - Allow students to **evaluate** their work and its implications?
* **T** - Be **tailored** (personalized) to the different needs, interests, and abilities of learners?
* **O** - Be **organized** to maximize initial and sustained engagement as well as effective learning?

**Connection to Big Ideas:** The learning plan should ensure that Big Ideas are uncovered through inquiry activities and explicit instruction. The overall goal is to help students make sense of the content, connect discrete facts and skills to larger ideas, apply this knowledge in meaningful ways, and see the purpose of learning activities.
{% endhint %}





<details>

<summary>Design Checklist</summary>

* [ ] Makes clear to students what they will be learning, what is expected of them (i.e., their performance goals), and how their work will be evaluated.
* [ ] Diagnostic assessments are used in the beginning to check for potential misunderstandings and predictable performance (skill) errors.
* [ ] Clearly designed to engage students, with special emphasis on the opening lessons and activities.
* [ ] Designed to equip students with the prerequisite experiences necessary to understand the big ideas, and the needed information and skills upon which the understandings and performances depend.
* [ ] Opportunities are provided for students to rethink their prior and emerging understandings, and to revise their work based on feedback and guidance.
* [ ] Ongoing assessments of individual and group progress provide students with feedback and guidance.
* [ ] Has been personalized to accommodate the variety of learners' interests, styles, and abilities by differentiating content, process, and products.
* [ ] The sequence of learning activities has been organized to maximize student engagement and productivity.
