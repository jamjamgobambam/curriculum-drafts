# Lesson 5

## Warm Up (5 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** Let's take a look at a widely known application of computer vision – self-driving cars. While looking at this application, we’ll focus on who or what is affected by this technology. Push yourself to think as broadly as possible, beyond the most directly affected people or things.

🎥 **Video:** Show the first 2 minutes of the "Tesla Self Driving vs Everyday Roads" video.

**Teaching Tip**

The rest of this video has lots of similar moments to the ones shown in the first two minutes. If you think your students and the resulting class discussion about impacts would benefit from everyone seeing more of this journey, you may choose to have your students watch a longer chunk or the entire video before class.
{% endhint %}

💬 **Discuss:** _Who or what is affected by this technology?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** In just under two minutes of driving, this video shows lots of possible impacts of this technology on lots of different people and systems, such as the other drivers who are driving through the same intersections, any pedestrians trying to cross the roads, the driver himself, and less visible things like designers of roads and new intersections who might design these things differently knowing that self-driving cars would be using it. Push students to generate as large of a class list as possible. If students share answers where the connection to self-driving cars isn’t immediately apparent from the video, ask them to say more so that others can hear about the thinking that connects the two.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Today will be our last day working on the Defining stage. The goal for your work today is to walk away with a core issue that your group can focus your problem-solving skills on when you move to Ideating and beyond.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Let’s start by looking at an example problem a group might be working on related to school lunch. This group noticed an issue with how students were interacting and collected some data from students to better understand this issue.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Here’s the data these students collected and visualized. Take a minute to look at the graph and consider these two questions: What do you notice? What do you wonder? For both of these questions, there are no right or wrong answers so let your ideas flow.

☑️ **Do This:** Give students some 30 secs to 1 minute to process the data and think through their responses to the questions before starting a class discussion.

💬 **Discuss:** _What do you notice? What do you wonder?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The point of this discussion is to normalize throwing out lots of different ideas without judgement of right or wrong. Push students to elaborate and explain any noticings or wonders that arise. For example, if a student shares, “I noticed that not many students spent time talking with others during lunch,” you can push them to point to exactly what part of the graph made them notice that, towards something like “I noticed that only 29% of the students said they spend lunch talking with other people, which is less than half as many people who said they spend lunch on their phones”. Some other students may wonder why the percentages add up to more than 100% which might lead to questions about how the survey way designed.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Once we have examined our data, we can use that to help us create fictional characters called user personas that will help continue to make sure we are defining the problem from the perspective of our users.

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce user personas.

> 🎙️ **Say:** We can use what we noticed from the graph to help us create user personas this helps us continue to stay grounded in empathizing with our users.

**Group:** Place students in their project groups.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group a copy of the User Stories and Problem Statements activity guide.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to complete the "User Stories" section of the User Stories and Problem Statements activity guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Check to make sure students are framing things from the perspective of the user, starting with “As a…”

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce the example user persona and first why.

☑️ **Do This:** Explain that answering this question requires outside knowledge or experience.

🎙️ Say In order to get to larger issues, we sometimes need to ask “Why”. This is a strategy called the 5 Why’s. The goal is to keep asking why until we get to a core issue that might be causing this problem. Once we’ve discovered the core issue, we can try to create a computer vision application to help solve it

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Notice how this group continues to ask “Why” to help dig deeper.

🟡 Click the animation until all the Whys show

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to complete the "5 Whys" section of the activity guide using the user personas they just created for their project.

**Assessment Opportunity**

The responses in the activity guide can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
{% endhint %}

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce problem statements.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

Problems Statements are related to Issue Statements, a component of Design Thinking, which is a larger framework for creatively addressing community issues. For more tips and background on Issue Statements, consider reading these articles here and here
{% endhint %}

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce the tips for writing a problem statement.

> 🎙️ **Say:** This group pulled out a theme from the answers to the Whys related to people feeling isolated and turned that into an issue statement. The core issue is something they can now focus on when they move to the Ideating phase next.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to write a problem statement in their activity guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** If groups have finished going through the process of turning one user persona into a core issue, have them attempt the process again, starting with one of the other user personas they identified at the beginning of this activity.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

The User Stories will be revisited in Lesson 14, so you may consider collecting these at the end of class.
{% endhint %}

💬 **Discuss:** _What problem statements did you come up with? How did you get to these statements from your user stories?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Get 2-3 different groups to share out to see how these statements can be framed differently.

💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Level 1 to complete their reflection questions on Levels 1, 2, and 3.

* _Explain what a user persona is and how it helps in designing a computer vision application._
* _Describe a user story you created based on your data visualizations. What data informed this story?_
* _How did you transition from your user story to developing a core problem statement? Provide an example from your work._

💡 **Reflection Goals:** Students should be able to articulate that a user persona is a fictional character created based on research to represent a user type that might use the application, emphasizing how it helps focus design efforts to meet specific user needs. This question assesses students' ability to analyze data visualizations and extract insights that inform the creation of a user story, demonstrating the link between data interpretation and user-centered design. Students should explain the process of identifying core issues from user stories by asking "Why?" multiple times, showcasing their understanding of digging deeper into user needs to define a core problem.
