☑️ **Do This:** Instructions for the teacher to do

💬 **Discuss:** discussion prompt

💡 **Discussion Goal:** what the teacher should be listening for in the discussion

💻 **Transition:** where students should be transitioning to

✏️ **Vocabulary:** new term being introduced

🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Video Title"

🟡 Click the animation

📄 **Distribute:** Give each student/pair of students a copy of the Activity Title activity guide.

> 🎙️ **Say:** thing for the teacher to say

🔁 **Circulate:** what the teacher should be looking out for while walking the classroom

Teaching Tip: Title teaching tip content

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment assessment opportunity content

> 🎙️ **Say:** We have already created a sample model using Teachable Machine that might be used in our computer vision application, and today we will expand our prototypes to include other ways to show our users what our design might offer them.

☑️ **Do This:** Have students vote by showing the corresponding number of fingers (or any pre-existing system you might have in your classroom) for the choice they think is most compelling. Use this vote to ask one student for each answer to explain why they picked the one they did.

💬 **Discuss:** The video describes three reasons for creating a prototype: Explore Inspire Converse Which one do you find most compelling?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Get students to use their own words to describe and define these reasons from the video.

In the case that no students raise their hands for some of the choices here is how you can summarize those points: One, to explore what is possible– sometimes it is difficult to know what is possible without trying it; a prototype is a low stakes way of assessing possibilities. Two, to inspire your users– seeing is believing. Without putting some form of a product into a user’s hands, it might be difficult to convey the true depth of the experience. And third, to converse– to begin a dialogue about how the product can solve a key problem for users. The prototype can begin a conversation with users that will lead to further development and iteration, which often only makes the solution stronger in the end.

☑️ **Do This:** Prompt students to write down their response to this question and give them 1 minute to do so before moving on to the next slide facilitate Give One, Get One.

☑️ **Do This:** Use the musical prompt to get students up and moving around the room. Remind students to continue to find new partners to share with until the music stops. Once students have returned to their seats, you can facilitate a whole class discussion.

💬 **Discuss:** How might failure in the prototyping stage actually be looked upon as a good thing?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students will most likely bring up the lessons learned through failure as a positive. If none of the students bring it up, discuss with students that it can be a struggle to discard ideas. However, being willing to move on from a solution that doesn’t fit can actually be a freeing experience.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Lesson Objectives

> 🎙️ **Say:** Question of the Day

> 🎙️ **Say:** Over the next two days, we are going to shift quickly into PBL Time so that you get the maximum time possible to add to your prototypes.

💬 **Discuss:** In addition to your Teachable Machine model, what else can be added to your prototype?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This is an opportunity to allow students to dream big. However, the main goal of this discussion, in addition to hearing what other groups might be considering, is to try to constrain the scope of the prototype. Students will often propose something more grand in scope than is possible in the time that is given to them. Therefore, trying to keep a reasonable expectation of what is expected and possible over the next two class periods is a useful discussion to engage in.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Here are some possibilities that you and your group might consider and which fit within the scope of the prototype. You might be unfamiliar with some of these ideas, but that doesn’t mean that you should count them out. A little quick research might show you that it might be the best solution to your prototyping needs.

> 🎙️ **Say:** These are our three main goals over the next two class periods:

You and your group will be deciding upon and creating additions to your computer vision prototype.

You should also take the opportunity to use the rubric to assess the state of your project – are there places that lack detail? Where can your overall project be improved?

You should also make make use of me in order to conference while you work. These conferences can take a couple of different forms– a feedback conference is when you ask for my thoughts on your prototype and the ideas that you are working through; an assessment conference is when we assess your project together.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work, you may need a jolt of inspiration to find the perfect idea for how to improve your prototype. If that’s the case, feel free to come up and use one of our Inspiration Cards! They will give you one concrete item that you can add to your prototype.

📄 **Distribute:** Make the Inspiration Cards available at the front of the room, or some similar location.

Teaching Tip: Title Placing the cards face-down and allowing students to choose them adds a little mystery and randomness to the process, and may help to expose students to ideas / design choices that they might not have considered before. You might also consider making more than one set if you anticipate that there is going to be a lot of groups that need to be inspired from the get-go.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work with your group, we will be using a series of non-verbal communication signals in order to communicate your group’s needs. You will be receiving a stack of different color cups, with each cup symbolizing a different status. The cup that is on the top of the stack – the one most visible – will be what determines your group’s status. Blue cup - All Good! Working well! Red cup - Stuck / Need help… Purple cup - Assessment conference request Yellow cup - Feedback conference request

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group one stack of cups containing each of the four colors.

Teaching Tip: Title There are two options that are presented in the slide deck. If you don’t have access to cups, there is an option to fold colored construction paper in order to accomplish the same signals. You can also modify this slide to create a different color-coding system that fits with materials that you may have on hand.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment Over the course of the two work days, you should attempt to have an assessment conference with each group. These conferences should be quick and focused, and should ideally point out only one to two aspects of the project that the group can revise in order to make it stronger. The idea is to focus on what will give them the best return on their limited time.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work with your group, we will be using a series of non-verbal communication signals in order to communicate your group’s needs. You will be receiving 4 different colors of construction paper, with each color symbolizing a different status. First, fold them into a tent shape and stack them together, The color that is on the top of the stack – the one most visible – will be what determines your group’s status. Blue - All Good! Working well! Red - Stuck / Need help… Purple - Assessment conference request Yellow - Feedback conference request

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group four colors of construction paper.

Teaching Tip: Title This is an alternate slide that you can use, depending on the materials that you have available.

☑️ **Do This:** Students should navigate to Level 1 and answer the reflection question in the space available.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment Reading through student responses before the start of the next class will be helpful to course correct any issues or misunderstandings, and to better address student needs on Day Two.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Learning Objectives

> 🎙️ **Say:** Question of the Day

> 🎙️ **Say:** Key Vocabulary

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss their experiences with the models they just created and tested. Students can refer to their CV Design Document to see some guiding questions that will help them evaluate their models.

🎙️ Remarks: Your model will be the first component of a larger prototype that you will be designing and building out over the next few class sessions. From here, what you create and how you create it will be the decision of the group. As we build on to our prototypes, we will learn more about some of the options that are available to us, and the various forms that it might take. This Teachable Machine model is a great first step in prototyping!

> 🎙️ **Say:** We will be moving from Ideating …

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** … to Prototyping today as we work with making models in Teachable Machine.

As you ideated with your group members, you came up with lots of impressive ideas. Prototyping involves taking the most promising of these ideas and making something tangible with it. We will not be creating a whole product, rather we will be creating parts of it so that it can be tested with our users. Prototypes are intended to be quick representations of what our ideas can look like – they are not perfected final versions. The more ideas that we have and which we are able to incorporate into our prototype, the better data our testing will give at the end of the process.
