# Lesson 2

## Overview (Teacher)

**Question of the Day :** How can we put ourselves in the shoes of our users?

This lesson introduces students to the Design Thinking Process focusing on the Empathize step of the process. In this lesson, students brainstorm communities they belong to and learn how to use observations of problems and issues a community is facing to generate questions that would help better understand the needs of members in that community. This lesson also introduces group roles as a way to streamline collaborative tasks.

🎙️&#x20;

> 🎙️ **Say:** Yesterday we saw a range of applications for computer vision and discussed ways that this technology impacts us in our own lives. Over the next few lessons, we will look more closely at some specific examples of computer vision applications. We will also look at this applications from the different perspectives shown on the slide. Today, we will look at one of the companies mentioned in the video yesterday, Farmwise, which builds automated weeding technology. While we watch the video, there are some guiding questions to consider that lead up to the larger question of “Who benefits from using this technology?”

🎥 **Video:** Watch the videos about Farmwise together as a class, and have students think about the guiding questions listed.

What specific problem does this technology help solve? How does this technology incorporate computer vision? Who benefits from this technology?

💬 **Discuss:** What could be an unintended negative consequence of this technology?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Use this discussion to get students to see that there are multiple sides to most things. Some topics that students might bring up or that you could prompt students to think about: Loss of jobs for farm workers Lack of access to this technology for smaller farms, making it harder for them to compete Data security when it comes to farming techniques such as placement of or spacing between plants

Teaching Tip: Pacing Move on from the discussion after 10 minutes. It’s okay if these case studies bring up more questions than answers! If you find your class generating a lot of questions, you could consider capturing these in a Parking Lot or on a KWL Chart.

> 🎙️ **Say:** We will continue to look at more case studies throughout the next few lessons. For the rest of today, let’s take a look at a process that teams use to develop applications such as the one we just looked at.

☑️ **Do This:** Use the following slides to introduce students to the Design thinking process.

> 🎙️ **Say:** The Design Thinking Process involves 5 parts that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Let’s break this down a bit more.

Teaching Tip: Design Thinking is a larger framework for creatively addressing community issues that we’ve adapted here. For more tips and background on Design Thinking, consider reading these articles here and here

📄 **Distribute:** Design Thinking and Communities I Belong To Activity Guide.

> 🎙️ **Say:** This process and the stages involved are things you’ve all done at different points in your life. As we go through this one-by-one, think about times when you’ve done something similar and write those down on your activity guide.

When designing an application or product, these parts all work together, and it all starts with Empathize

> 🎙️ **Say:** This diagram shows how all of these steps work together in a cycle, without a specific start, end, or direction. You can probably think of many times where you’ve used this process or parts of it in your life.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** You will notice that Empathize comes in the middle and that’s our focus for today. Remember, Empathize in design means “paying attention to a user’s feelings and needs when designing a product.” But what does that actually mean in practice?

> 🎙️ **Say:** Here’s an example of how a group of designers might empathize with their users involving the company we saw in the warm up video, Farmwise:

☑️ **Do This:** Ask a student to read the quote out loud to the rest of the class.

💬 **Discuss:** What might the FarmWise employees have learned from interviewing farmers about the difficulties they face?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** You’ll return to some possible examples for this later in the lesson, so for this discussion, try to encourage as wide a range of possibilities as possible instead of going into depth on any one idea.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Next, we are going to start the process of being designers ourselves. To start the process, we need to figure out who we are designing for, which involves finding a community with a need. To help with this, we are all going to brainstorm a list of communities that we belong to in our Unit Guides. Here is an example of how this brainstorm might look:

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** These can be general communities related to characteristics such as age…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Interests…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Location…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Pets…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Or any number of other characteristics. A community can be however you define it, so feel free to include any community you belong to.

☑️ **Do This:** Give students a few minutes to complete the “Communities I Belong To” section in their Unit Guide.

☑️ **Do This:** Give One, Get One: Use the musical cue on the slides to facilitate the timing of students walking around the room to share responses with each other.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Next, we are going to practice turning observations about problems facing a community into questions that will allow us to gather more information about our users’ needs. For this, let’s return to the example of FarmWise employees volunteering on farms and interviewing farmers.

We already discussed some things that the FarmWise employees might have learned from their interviews. Let’s break down the process of gathering that information a little bit more, starting with some observations that the designers might have made while volunteering as a part of the farming community: Lack of access to enough water Trouble finding enough workers to hire Challenges minimizing the loss of crops due to pests and disease.

These problems and the needs associated with them might be obvious to members of the community, but as designers, our job is to find out more about what our users need instead of making assumptions. To do this, we need to dig a bit deeper by talking with users, just like the FarmWise employees interviewed farmers.

Turning these observations into research questions will help you as a designer gather more data about your users and help you more clearly define the problem you are trying to solve.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Here is an example of a question that the employees at FarmWise might have asked to learn more about the issue of water scarcity. Can you think of questions they might ask about labor shortages or pest and disease management?

☑️ **Do This:** Give students a minute to process and brainstorm possible questions before asking a few students to share possible questions.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Nice job coming up with questions of your own! Here are other examples of questions that might have been helpful. Notice that most of them are framed in an open-ended way, asking the user to describe experiences they’ve had.

Teaching Tip: Examples From Class You may choose to use examples from the class discussion earlier in place of the ones provided on the slide if you think those are issues that your class will better understand and resonate with.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Soon, we will get into groups to work on developing research questions. Before we do, we will establish roles for when we collaborate. For today, you will work in groups of 3, with each person playing a different role.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the timekeeper. This person is in charge of making sure the group stays on time with each chunk of work.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the scribe. This person is in charge of recording key points from discussions and documenting the group’s work.

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the Task Manager. This person is in charge of making sure the group understands the task at hand and keeps the group on task throughout the work.

Having specific roles in a group helps us work together smoothly, just like in real jobs where everyone has a special role to make big projects succeed. Think of working in a group like being on a movie set: everyone has a specific job to do. Just like a director guides a movie and a sound engineer captures the best audio, each role helps us tackle tasks more effectively, improving our collaboration skills.

☑️ **Do This:** Group students into groups of 3.

📄 **Distribute:** Pass out the Problem Observations → Research Questions activity guide.

☑️ **Do This:** Give students a clear amount of time to complete this, given where you are in the class period. You may want to project a digital timer at the front of the room.

🔁 **Circulate:** As groups work together, walk around the room to observe and listen to how students are doing with group roles, noting anything you’d like to bring up as part of the wrap up.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to move to a part of the room where they can gather with all of the other people who played the same role as them.

☑️ **Do This:** Use the “Role Debrief” slide to help anchor discussions in each group. Give the groups a few minutes to discuss the two prompts.

Have each group share out their one piece of advice to the whole class and add in any of your own observations that you think are worth including

Teaching Tip: Anchor Charts The share outs from this wrap-up could make for the start of a useful classroom anchor chart on group roles and advice for people using those roles.
