# lesson-4







Warm Up (10 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** Today, we’ll begin by examining a case study of computer vision in action by looking at “smart” robot vacuum cleaners. Let’s start by examining the unique design challenges their designers had to overcome to make create these robotic cleaning technologies. We’ll also examine how data might be used to make informed decisions about possible solutions.

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce robotic vacuum cleaners.


☑️ **Do This:** Explain that features and functions are often based on data gathered from users.


💬 **Discuss:** What insight does this graph offer about users?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The histogram clearly shows that a majority of robot vacuum users are very concerned that their expensive cleaning product will tumble down the stairs. Gathering and visualizing data in this way can very quickly point out important areas of focus when designing products. There is an opportunity to make an inference about the second largest bar in the graph which indicates folks that are not concerned about it. You might want to prompt students and ask why people might not be worried (they live in an apartment with one floor, for instance). This will connect to the idea of creating User Personas which will be the focus of the next lesson.


💬 **Discuss:** What feature might help address this need?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Here, students can speculate as to how robot vacuums might overcome this challenge. A main point is that there needs to be a camera or other sensor built into the machine that can identify and avoid areas where there is a sudden drop. Ideally, this should be something that the robot can determine on its own, rather than having to have users erect barriers or use other means to discourage the robot from tipping over the edge.


> 🎙️ **Say:** We have already identified that falling down the stairs might be a danger both for the robot and for the owner’s wallet. Let’s take a moment to empathize with the robot vacuum itself– what challenges and dangers does it have to overcome on a daily basis in order to do its job well?

☑️ **Do This:** Have students work together with a partner to quickly brainstorm some obvious dangers or challenges that a robot vacuum might face as it attempts to clean. 

🔁 **Circulate:** Help students ideate if they appear stuck. Possible responses to help prompt groups might include:

Obstacle navigation
Avoiding damaging household items
Stairs and drops
Overzealous (and playful) pets
Different types of surfaces
Battery life
Getting entangled / jammed
Not leaving behind dirty “blind spots”



☑️ **Do This:** Have students select one of the dangers/challenges that they identified. Have them brainstorm a possible solution. Mention to the groups that it is not necessary to come up with a detailed / technical solution– being able to describe what a general solution might look like ideal.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Just like you did with your groups today, the designers of robot vacuums had to examine as many challenges and dangers to the product as possible so that they could design a product that was able to meet and overcome them. Gathering data from users and from testing was essential to know how to create the best possible product. 









Activity (30 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** Today we are moving to the Defining step. In this step, we are going to see if we can use data to help define what problem or issue is the most important to solve. The focus of today’s lesson will be to explore how you might take data and represent it visually. Many times, visualizing data is necessary in order to see patterns that might not be obvious otherwise. From these visualizations and patterns, solid decisions can be made that keep a user’s needs in focus.




> 🎙️ **Say:** Defining helps us set goals for the solution to our problem…


Group: Place students in pairs or small groups of 3.

💻 **Transition:** Direct students to Lesson 4, Level 1. Have students make a copy of the Sample Dataset and the Data Visualizations activity guide.


☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to Level 2 and have them explore the provided resources.


☑️ **Do This:** Have students work through creating visualizations using the sample data provided within Google Sheets. Students should document the visualizations on the activity guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you move through the classroom helping students, use the following tips to assist students in need:
Select the data cells that you want to visualize by mousing over them with the left mouse button down.
Histograms and line graphs are often the easiest visualizations to create for students.
Introduce the Customize menu in the Chart Editor – this allows them to have better control over the labels, looks, and presentation of their data.
Encourage the students to try different chart types within the Editor, seeing which one best fits their data.
Creating visualizations for qualitative data in Sheets is difficult! Ways that students could overcome this challenge would be to look at the most important words in the data and to keep track of the frequency with which these words appear. With the data presented in that fashion, a histogram could be created that would highlight the most used terms, and thus, indicate what might be most important to users.
[Advanced] Formulas such as =SUM() and =AVERAGE() can be used to aggregate data.

Teaching Tip
As you find interesting visualizations while circulating, it might be helpful to take a moment to highlight a few students’ work to share with the class what have created and the kinds of conclusions/insights/inferences that have drawn.



☑️ **Do This:** Have each student group join one other group. They should walk through one of the visualizations that they created and documented in their activity guide. They should use the conversation with their peers as an opportunity to revise their work, add detail, or formulate new questions that arise.

🔁 **Circulate:** As the groups work together, use this as an opportunity to get a quick pulse check on common issues and successes that the groups encountered. These can be useful to prime conversation in the whole class discussion that will be held at the end of this activity.


💬 **Discuss:** What types of visualizations worked best for the data we explored? Why?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students likely found that histograms, bar charts, pie charts and line charts were the best types of visualizations to use when just looking at the data for one question. These visualizations showed clear peaks and valleys which can then be used when a group is making a observation/question/inference. For examining multiple columns of data, a scatter plot might have been the most appropriate. Students will see that there are clusters of points that appear on the scatter plot that might indicate different types of users and needs.


💬 **Discuss:** What data was most difficult to visualize? Were you able to find a way to overcome that challenge?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Using Google Sheets, visualizing the qualitative data would most likely be the most difficult. If students use scatter plots, they may also find the way that the data is presented to be difficult to work with. Underscore the importance of productive struggle here – emphasizing that not everything that we do will yield results. It is through the process of exploration and experimentation that we, over time, can refine our visualizations.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Now that we have had some experience with creating basic data visualizations, let’s turn our attention to our own data that we gathered in our surveys. Let’s use the techniques that we experimented with in Google Sheets in order to create a visualization that offers an insight about what is important target community/audience.

☑️ **Do This:** With their group partner(s), students should analyze the data that they gathered from their target community. Students should create at least one data visualization to aid in understanding their audience’s needs better.

🔁 **Circulate:** Assist students with formatting their data into columns, if necessary. If the students used Google Forms, they can export their results as a spreadsheet with columns directly into Google Sheets. Encourage them to experiment with different types of visualizations in order to create a visualization that they can then use to make an observation, ask a question, or draw an inference. 

Teaching Tip
The easiest graphs to work with inside of Google Sheets for the type of data that students have likely gathered includes:
Bar Graphs / Histograms
Line Graphs / Area Charts
Pie Charts
Scatter Plots



Wrap Up (5 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** Review Lesson Objectives


> 🎙️ **Say:** Review Question of the Day


💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 4, Level 1  to complete their reflection question about their data visualization.
What was one observation, question, or inference that you can make about the data that you have gathered based on your visualization?

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
Review the different analyses that students performed on their data in order to know which groups might need more assistance at the next stage of project development, in which they will be taking this observation / question / inference and turning it into a user persona that attempts to define the type of user that might use their product, and what problem they have that might be potentially solved with a computer vision application.
