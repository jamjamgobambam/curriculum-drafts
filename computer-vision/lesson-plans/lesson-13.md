# Lesson 13

## Warm Up (10 mins)

💻 **Transition:** Direct students to Level 1 to select the types of prototypes they worked on in the last class. Question– What prototype component(s) have you implemented in your project thus far? Storyboards Paper Prototypes Digital mockup UI Hot Spot activity Annotated images Image filters Flowcharting Other

☑️ **Do This:** Share the results with students so that they can see how other groups are tackling this phase of the project.

**Teaching Tip**

Sharing Results Multiple choice/answer quizzes within Code.org have the option to share the results with the students. This can provide good instantaneous data about how students are choosing to tackle this assignment, and might serve as an inspiration for students who might be moving slower through the process. If there are certain components that are more popular than others, that might make for an interesting class discussion.

💬 **Discuss:** _What is working best about your approach to your prototype thus far?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This allows students the opportunity to share with one another about the status of their project. By sharing positive practices and things that are working well, it can serve as positive reinforcement for other groups– they might adopt the approach / strategy in their own project.

💬 **Discuss:** _What ideas have you had to scrap and/or iterate on?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Asking this question reinforces the important idea that part of prototyping involves trying (and sometimes failing). Reinforce that the act of self-evaluation and iteration are incredibly important components of both Design Thinking and Project-Based Learning. In the event a student states that they have not had to scrap or iterate on any ideas, encourage the student to think more broadly about the design and development process, emphasizing that iteration doesn't always mean making large, noticeable changes. Sometimes, iteration can be as subtle as tweaking a user interface element, adjusting the wording in instructions, or changing the flow of a process based on potential user feedback. Ask the student to reflect on any aspect of their project that required even minor adjustments or where they faced challenges, even if those challenges didn't lead to drastic changes. Highlight that the iterative process is about continuous improvement and learning from both what works and what doesn't, encouraging a mindset of ongoing refinement and resilience.

## Activity (30 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work with your group, we will be using a series of non-verbal communication signals in order to communicate your group’s needs. You will be receiving a stack of different color cups, with each cup symbolizing a different status. The cup that is on the top of the stack – the one most visible – will be what determines your group’s status.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to self-assess their project using the rubric. Remind students to reference an Inspiration Card if they need it.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group one stack of cups containing each of the four colors.

## Wrap Up (5 mins)

💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Level 2 to complete their reflection question on Levels 2 and 3.

* _Reflect on the prototyping process so far. What aspects of your prototype are you most proud of, and why?_
* _How have you prepared your prototype for user testing, and what are you hoping to learn from this phase?_

💡 **Reflection Goal:** Encourages students to think critically about their work, focusing on achievements and innovations they've introduced in their prototype, fostering a sense of accomplishment and encouraging peer-to-peer learning. Students should discuss their preparations for the testing phase, what they aim to learn from user interactions, and how they plan to use this feedback to further refine their computer vision applications.

**Assessment Opportunity**

The responses in the level can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
