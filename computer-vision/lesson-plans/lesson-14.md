# lesson-14







Warm Up (5 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** We have reached the last step of the Design Thinking Process - testing! You'll have the unique opportunity to see our computer vision project through someone else's eyes. By stepping into the roles of different users, you'll gain insights into how our designs can truly meet their needs and where we might need to pivot or improve.





> 🎙️ **Say:** Testing our prototypes to see what we can improve or do differently moving forward.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Imagine the world from this user's perspective. What are their daily challenges, wants, and needs? How might our computer vision application impact their lives, for better or worse? Consider not just the functionality of the application but its ease of use, accessibility, and potential implications on privacy and security from your user's standpoint.

💬 **Discuss:** What feedback might an elderly driver have about object detection?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students should be sharing feedback on the application from the perspective of their assigned user. Prompt them to consider how the application meets the user's needs, any potential challenges the user might face, and suggestions for improvement.


💬 **Discuss:** What feedback might a patient with a chronic condition have about x-ray analysis?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students should be sharing feedback on the application from the perspective of their assigned user. Prompt them to consider how the application meets the user's needs, any potential challenges the user might face, and suggestions for improvement.



💬 **Discuss:** What feedback might a retail employee have about self-checkout?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students should be sharing feedback on the application from the perspective of their assigned user. Prompt them to consider how the application meets the user's needs, any potential challenges the user might face, and suggestions for improvement.



💬 **Discuss:** What did you find interesting or challenging about role-playing as this user?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Facilitate a reflection on the role-playing exercise to enhance students' grasp of user-centered design. Key points to be on the lookout for and to explicitly bring out in the event students do not mention them:
Identify Assumptions: Encourage sharing of initial assumptions about the user or technology that changed through role-playing.
Express Challenges: Prompt discussion on specific challenges faced in understanding and representing the user's perspective, emphasizing realizations about the user's context and needs.
Share Strategies: Highlight strategies or insights that aided empathy with the user or improved role-play accuracy.
Actionable Insights: Focus on constructive feedback from the role-play that can directly inform design improvements or ethical considerations.


💬 **Discuss:** What are some important details that you needed to know to be able to play the role more effectively?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The goal of this discussion if for students to reflect on this experience so that they know how to better engage as the user for the main lesson activity where they will be user testing in the role of different users. This discussion should highlight the importance of detailed user knowledge in developing empathy and creating user-centric solutions. Key points to listen for or bring out: 
Specific User Needs and Preferences: Encourage students to discuss the specific needs, preferences, or challenges of their user that were crucial for accurate role-playing. This includes any particular habits, limitations, or desires that impacted how they viewed the technology.
User Context and Environment: Prompt students to consider the user's environment or context and how it affects their interaction with the technology. Listen for mentions of physical, social, or cultural contexts that influence usability and accessibility.
Barriers to Technology Use: Focus on discussions about potential barriers the user might face when using the technology, including technological literacy, physical accessibility issues, or socio-economic factors.
User Goals with the Technology: Highlight conversations on what the user aims to achieve with the technology and how understanding these goals is crucial for effective role-playing and design thinking.
Feedback on Missing Information: Pay attention to any feedback indicating gaps in their knowledge that hindered effective role-playing. This can guide any needed adjustments to the user testing in the main activity.










Activity (30 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** Now that you’ve had some practice thinking about applications from the perspective of a specific user, we're going to step into the shoes of potential users for our classmates’ CV applications. Your feedback will help them understand diverse needs and refine their designs, so it is extremely important to engage with each project from the perspective of the assigned user persona as you test each prototype.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group 6-8 User Feedback sheets.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to set out their idea outlines, user personas, blank User Feedback sheets, and their prototype.



☑️ **Do This:** Have students participate in the gallery walk, emphasizing the importance of engaging with each project from the perspective of one of the user personas.

🔁 **Circulate:** Observe student engagement, ensuring they are interacting with prototypes and discussing their observations. Watch for thoughtful, persona-driven feedback.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Great work today, everyone! You've all taken a significant step in understanding the diverse perspectives of users who might interact with your projects. Now, as we transition from the gallery walk, let’s have a quick look into the feedback you've received. Don’t worry, we are going to do a deep dive into all of your user feedback tomorrow - for right now, let’s just take a quick look to see if anything pops out right away!

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to read through their feedback and discuss with their partner. Let students know that they will focus more on taking a deep dive into their user feedback in the next lesson and that for our purposes right now, they should just take a moment to identify any common themes, surprises or any actionable suggestions that they notice immediately. 



💬 **Discuss:** How did role-playing as a user alter your view of the projects you reviewed, and what key insight did you gain?

💡 **Discussion Goal:**  This discussion should encourage students to articulate how adopting a user persona expanded their understanding of user experience and to identify a pivotal insight that could influence their approach to design thinking and empathy in future projects.


💬 **Discuss:** From your initial glance at your user feedback, what common theme or surprising insight stood out, and how does it challenge or affirm your initial assumptions about your project?

💡 **Discussion Goal:**  The goal of this discussion is to prompt students to quickly synthesize and reflect on the initial feedback, encouraging them to identify immediate reactions that either challenge or confirm their preconceptions about their project. The aim is to cultivate an openness to revising their work based on user input (in preparation for tomorrow) and to underscore the importance of being adaptable and responsive to feedback in the design process.


Wrap Up (5 mins)








💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 14, Level 1 to complete their reflection questions on Levels 1 through 3.
What can we learn by testing our design in front of our intended users?
How did role-playing as a user persona change your perspective on the computer vision applications you reviewed?
What was the most surprising or insightful piece of feedback you received, and how will it influence your project moving forward?

💡 Reflection Goal:  
Responses should reflect an understanding that user testing is essential for creating solutions that are genuinely useful and user-friendly. Students should mention how testing with intended users ensures the product meets real-world needs and usability standards.
Encourages students to reflect on how adopting a user persona provided new insights into the user experience, highlighting the value of empathy in designing user-centered solutions.
Students should evaluate how feedback from diverse perspectives can offer unexpected insights, and how such feedback can drive the project to better meet user needs or address previously overlooked issues.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
The responses in the level can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
