# lesson-14










> 🎙️ **Say:** We have reached the last step of the Design Thinking Process - Testing! You'll have the unique opportunity to see our computer vision project through someone else's eyes. By stepping into the roles of different users, you'll gain insights into how our designs can truly meet their needs and where we might need to pivot or improve.





☑️ **Do This:** Distribute different user stories around the classroom.

> 🎙️ **Say:** In a moment, I’m going to present you and your partner with a few computer vision applications. Your job is to imagine the world from the perspective of one of the users on your cards. What are their daily challenges, wants, and needs? How might the computer vision application impact their lives, for better or worse? What suggestions for improvement might your user have? Consider not just the functionality of the application but its ease of use, accessibility, and potential implications on privacy and security from your user's standpoint. 

Teaching Tip: Extra User Card
A fourth blank user card has been provided in the event that you either have time for a fourth round of user feedback or would like students to assume a specific role. 


> 🎙️ **Say:** Imagine the world from your user's perspective. What are their daily challenges, wants, and needs? How might our computer vision application impact their lives, for better or worse? Consider not just the functionality of the application but its ease of use, accessibility, and potential implications on privacy and security from your user's standpoint.

☑️ **Do This:** Present the slide with the first computer vision application to the class. Ask students to discuss feedback on the application from the perspective of their assigned user. Prompt them to consider how the application meets the user's needs, any potential challenges the user might face, and suggestions for improvement.

🔁 **Circulate:** Ensure students are genuinely attempting to understand and empathize with their assigned user’s perspective, rather than superficially guessing what the user might think or feel. For example, a vision impaired user may have strong opinions on the importance of accessibility features and voice-activated controls or concerns about privacy and data security, especially if the technology requires personal data to customize accessibility options. As you walk around, ask students who might be superficially guessing, probing questions (why do you think that) to help them dive deeper into their user perspective.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Remember to try to go beyond surface-level observations to address deeper implications of the technology’s use, including potential barriers, accessibility concerns and ethical considerations.

☑️ **Do This:** Present the sample computer vision application to the class. Ask students to discuss feedback on the application from the perspective of their assigned user. Prompt them to consider how the application meets the user's needs, any potential challenges the user might face, and suggestions for improvement.

🔁 **Circulate:** Continue to ensure students are genuinely attempting to understand and empathize with their assigned user’s perspective, rather than superficially guessing what the user might think or feel. For example a patient with a chronic illness may have concerns about the accessibility of their results and privacy of their data. As you walk around, ask students who might be superficially guessing, probing questions (why do you think that) to help them dive deeper into their user perspective.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Last one … make sure you and your partner are respectfully questioning each other’s assumptions and suggesting meaningful improvements or raising important ethical questions.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Let's chat about any insights we've gathered from this role-playing exercise. Reflect on the process of embodying your user's perspective and think about what surprised you, what challenges you encountered in providing feedback, and how this process has helped your understanding of user feedback.

Teaching Tip: Debrief Option Prior to Discussion Questions
If you have time, you may choose to ask students to share one piece of feedback their user may have had for the three computer vision applications. Since pairs had different users for each round, it may be helpful for students to hear what their classmates thought other users might have said about each application.

💬 **Discuss:** What did you find interesting or challenging about role-playing as this user?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Facilitate a reflection on the role-playing exercise to enhance students' grasp of user-centered design. Key points to be on the lookout for and to explicitly bring out in the event students do not mention them:
Identify Assumptions: Encourage sharing of initial assumptions about the user or technology that changed through role-playing.
Express Challenges: Prompt discussion on specific challenges faced in understanding and representing the user's perspective, emphasizing realizations about the user's context and needs.
Share Strategies: Highlight strategies or insights that aided empathy with the user or improved role-play accuracy.
Actionable Insights: Focus on constructive feedback from the role-play that can directly inform design improvements or ethical considerations.

💬 **Discuss:** What are some important details that you needed to know to be able to play the role more effectively?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The goal of this discussion if for students to reflect on this experience so that they know how to better engage as the user for the main lesson activity where they will be user testing in the role of different users. This discussion should highlight the importance of detailed user knowledge in developing empathy and creating user-centric solutions. Key points to listen for or bring out: 
Specific User Needs and Preferences: Encourage students to discuss the specific needs, preferences, or challenges of their user that were crucial for accurate role-playing. This includes any particular habits, limitations, or desires that impacted how they viewed the technology.
User Context and Environment: Prompt students to consider the user's environment or context and how it affects their interaction with the technology. Listen for mentions of physical, social, or cultural contexts that influence usability and accessibility.
Barriers to Technology Use: Focus on discussions about potential barriers the user might face when using the technology, including technological literacy, physical accessibility issues, or socio-economic factors.
User Goals with the Technology: Highlight conversations on what the user aims to achieve with the technology and how understanding these goals is crucial for effective role-playing and design thinking.
Feedback on Missing Information: Pay attention to any feedback indicating gaps in their knowledge that hindered effective role-playing. This can guide any needed adjustments to the user testing in the main activity.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Now that you’ve had some practice thinking about applications from the perspective of a specific user, we're going to step into the shoes of potential users for our classmates’ CV applications. Your feedback will help them understand diverse needs and refine their designs, so it is extremely important to engage with each project from the perspective of the assigned user persona as you test each prototype.



📄 **Distribute:** Give each student pair a Problem Statement & Solution activity guide and User Feedback sheets

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to take out their User Story Playing Cards.

Teaching Tip: Printing Suggestion
The User Feedback Sheets should be printed double sided so that the Guided Reflection Questions are on the back of each sheet. You should print out 5-6 half sheets for each group.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to fill in the Problem Statement and Solution sections of their activity guide.




☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to set out their User Story Playing Cards from Lesson 5 and the blank set of User Feedback sheets along with their prototype. 



☑️ **Do This:** Explain the gallery walk instructions, emphasizing the importance of engaging with each project from the perspective of the assigned user persona.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you visit each station, immerse yourself in the role of your user. Consider their needs, challenges, and how the technology affects them.

🔁 **Circulate:** Observe student engagement, ensuring they are interacting with prototypes and discussing their observations. Watch for thoughtful, persona-driven feedback.




> 🎙️ **Say:** Great work today, everyone! You've all taken a significant step in understanding the diverse perspectives of users who might interact with your projects. Now, as we transition from the gallery walk, let’s have a quick look into the feedback you've received. Don’t worry, we are going to do a deep dive into all of your user feedback tomorrow - for right now, let’s just take a quick look to see if anything pops out right away!

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to read through their feedback and discuss with their partner. Let students know that they will focus more on taking a deep dive into their user feedback in tomorrow lesson and that for our purposes right now, they should just take a moment to identify any common themes, surprises or any actionable suggestions that they notice immediately. 




💬 **Discuss:** How did role-playing as a user persona alter your view of the projects you reviewed, and what key insight did you gain?

💡 **Discussion Goal:**  This discussion should encourage students to articulate how adopting a user persona expanded their understanding of user experience and to identify a pivotal insight that could influence their approach to design thinking and empathy in future projects.

💬 **Discuss:** From your initial glance at your user feedback, what common theme or surprising insight stood out, and how does it challenge or affirm your initial assumptions about your project?

💡 **Discussion Goal:**  The goal of this discussion is to prompt students to quickly synthesize and reflect on the initial feedback, encouraging them to identify immediate reactions that either challenge or confirm their preconceptions about their project. The aim is to cultivate an openness to revising their work based on user input (in preparation for tomorrow) and to underscore the importance of being adaptable and responsive to feedback in the design process.





💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 14, Levels 1-3 to complete their reflection questions. 

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
The reflection questions can be used as a formative assessment of student learning.
