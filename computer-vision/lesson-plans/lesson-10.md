Warm Up (10 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** Before we start testing and training our models today, we’re first going to warm up our creative skills and give us a firsthand look at the challenges and considerations involved in training a computer vision model. Let's imagine you are trying to teach a friend to recognize something they’ve never seen before. But, there’s a catch - you can only use images! This is similar to how we can train machine learning models in computer vision.

> 🎙️ **Say:** We provide them with examples, or "training data", to help them learn. 

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you can see in these images, the same subject can be represented in various ways depending on our viewpoint. Each perspective offers unique information about the subject. These drawings range from a frontal view to a side view, and back perspectives. We could have even had a top-down view or a zoomed in view as well. Notice how each view captures different details? Think about why this diversity in data would be crucial for training algorithms to recognize objects. 



> 🎙️ **Say:** It is now your turn to train your classmates! When you get your object card, make sure you do NOT show anyone! Keep this a secret!

Group: Place students into groups of 3-4.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each student one of the object cards.


☑️ **Do This:** Instruct students to draw their object on their card from one perspective. This can be whichever perspective they wish. 

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, remind students that their goal with each drawing is to try to capture the essence of the object in a way that others can recognize, despite not having it labeled. 



☑️ **Do This:** Instruct students to draw their object on their card from another perspective. This can be whichever perspective they wish. 

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, remind students that their goal with each drawing is to try to capture the essence of the object in a way that others can recognize, despite not having it labeled. 


☑️ **Do This:** Instruct students to draw their object on their card from a third perspective. This can be whichever perspective they wish. 



☑️ **Do This:** Instruct students to draw their object on their card from a final perspective. This can be whichever perspective they wish. 



☑️ **Do This:** Have students number their drawings with "1" being the least accurate or detailed and "4" being the most accurate or detailed.
 




☑️ **Do This:** Instruct students to take turns presenting their drawings to the other group members. Ensure students show one drawing at a time, starting with the one they think is the least accurate or detailed. After each drawing is shown, the other group members will make educated guesses about what the drawing is attempting to convey. 
 



💬 **Discuss:** How does this activity relate to how an AI model might be trained?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Just as diverse perspectives in drawings help students guess the object more accurately, diverse training data helps AI models improve their recognition capabilities across different conditions and contexts. In addition, while this was not an exercise in drawing ability, the quality and the level of accuracy and detail in the drawings potentially affected the guessing process. This is similar to how detailed and accurate data can significantly enhance an AI model's learning accuracy and its ability to make correct identifications or predictions



💬 **Discuss:** Why might it be important to see objects in multiple contexts? How might this assist with training an AI?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The goal is to further illuminate the critical need for AI systems to encounter objects in varied contexts for robust recognition and understanding. The question aims to drive home the point that exposing AI to multiple contexts enhances its ability to generalize across different scenarios, making it more effective in real-world applications. In essence, diversity in data is crucial for training algorithms to recognize objects in real-world situations, where conditions and angles can vary greatly.









Activity (30 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** We will be moving from Ideating to Prototyping today as we work with making models in Teachable Machine.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Prototyping means to actually try out our ideas so that we can get them in front of users.


💻 **Transition:** Direct students to Level 1 to access Teachable Machine.


☑️ **Do This:** Have students explore Teachable Machine. Encourage them to click around through the different sample options, create at least two classes, and to run the training to see what happens.



💬 **Discuss:** What did you notice as you explored the Teachable Machine?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Here are some key things students may notice:
The Machine Learns Quickly: Students might notice that Teachable Machine starts recognizing patterns or objects almost immediately after a few examples are shown.
Different Results with Small Changes: They may observe that slight changes (like moving the object closer or further, changing angles, or altering lighting) can lead to different recognition results.
Needs Examples to Understand: The machine requires examples to learn what an object looks like; it doesn't "know" anything until it's shown examples.
Fun and Interactive: Students might find the process of teaching the machine and seeing instant feedback engaging and surprising.

💬 **Discuss:** What do you wonder?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Student results will vary. Here are some common questions students might have after a short, five minute session with Teachable Machine:
Why does it sometimes get it wrong? Students might be curious about why the machine doesn't always recognize objects correctly, even if they've just shown it similar examples.
Does it remember what we showed it? They could wonder if the Teachable Machine retains the information from their session for the next time it's used.
Can it learn to recognize me? Some students might be intrigued by the possibility of the machine learning to recognize them personally or specific gestures they make.
How does it know what it's seeing so fast? The immediate feedback from the Teachable Machine might lead students to question how it processes information quickly.
What else can it learn to do? Curiosity about the scope of Teachable Machine's learning capabilities, wondering if it can learn tasks beyond simple object or gesture recognition.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss what kind of model(s) they want to create with their project group. Each student in the group should create their own model. 

Teaching Tip
There can be different models within the same group if the Computer Vision application has more complicated functions. Otherwise, group members can create the same type of model and compare results and experiences. 









☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to start a new Teachable Machine project and choose either an Image or Pose project. Students should document their model on the Training a Model activity guide as they work.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you move around the room, encourage students to retrain their models to get better results.


💬 **Discuss:** What did you think was the hardest part of creating your model? How did you overcome it? Any surprises about how your model performed?

💡 **Discussion Goal:**  This discussion should encourage students to articulate the problem-solving strategies they employed, highlighting the importance of creativity, persistence, and adaptability in the field of AI. It aims to provide students with insight into the iterative process of model development, including the importance of troubleshooting and refining based on performance feedback.





💬 **Discuss:** How do you envision that your model will be used?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is to inspire students to think creatively about the practical applications of their AI models, fostering a forward-thinking mindset. This encourages students to connect their technical skills with the real-world problem they are trying to solve, envisioning how their work could have a tangible impact.
