🎙Remarks
Today marks the beginning of our explorations with computer vision. We’re going to peel back the curtain and see how computers use images & video to “see” the world around them, turning pixels into patterns, and patterns into predictions. It’s a field of study that is ongoing, current, and with many applications now and in the near future that promise to change the way that society looks and functions.

💬 **Discuss:** How might we create an algorithm so that a computer can see the difference between “X” and “O”?  (2 min)
**Discussion Goal:** A simple algorithm that students might come up with is to test whether the corners are filled in; if so, then it must be an X. They might also suggest to test to see if the lines present cross each other. The main goal of this discussion will be to highlight traditional algorithmic thinking. Throughout the module, we will contrast this method of algorithmic development by accounting for using machine learning to train computer vision applications is changing the way that traditional algorithms are developed and implemented.Teaching Tip
Consider having students talk to a shoulder partner for a minute or two to discuss and work out an algorithm before beginning a whole class discussion.

💬 **Discuss:** Does your algorithm work for the examples of an “X” seen here?  Why or why not? (2 min)

**Discussion Goal:** If the algorithm that students came up with in the previous slide was too simplistic, it might not account for these other variations of X. However, it is important to point out that through the use of computer vision, the goal is to train a computer to recognize an “X” in new and novel implementations. 

🎙Remarks
Throughout this module we will be learning how computer scientists are developing sophisticated computer vision algorithms utilizing AI and data. By training these models with loads of data, the computer itself begins to write and tweak its own algorithms to help it decode and understand what an “X” might be. Even if it sees a version that it has never seen before, if the training was thorough enough, it should be able to recognize the letter. That is one of the goals of computer vision: to train computers to see and interpret the world around them just like we are able to do as human beings.

📄 **Distribute:** “The Search for Pixel” Activity Guide


Teaching Tip
“The Search for Pixel” activity is an interactive mystery game in which students will use a click-able slideshow that will navigate them to various locations around a fictional town. The goal of the activity is twofold: first and foremost, students will learn about and experience various computer vision techniques; second, students will attempt to use those techniques to help solve a mystery, finding out what happened to Pixel, a beloved, but missing cat. The game is divided into 6 rounds and each should take about 5 minutes to explore and complete. Using the first round as a model for how to interact with the interface is advisable. It is also recommended that you group students in pairs or triads in order to aid in the exploration and to make it more time-efficient.

In addition to the Activity Guide, there is a teacher resource that will walk you through how to navigate each round, includiung what clues there are to be found.

🎙Remarks
In order to learn a bit more about computer vision, you are all going to assume the roles of digital detectives today. You see, Pixel the cat, world famous for her thirty second advertisement for YumYumFishy Cat Bites, has gone missing! You will use an interactive Google Slide in order to visit different locations around the city, searching for information about what happened to the cat, and aided by use of computer vision techniques to reveal these clues. Have your Activity Guide and “The Search for Pixel” slide show on your computers. Click the “Slideshow” button in the upper-right corner of the screen in order to view the slides in slideshow mode. This way, you will be able to click different icons and interact with images within the slide.

🎙Remarks
Have your Activity Guide and “The Search for Pixel” slideshow ready to go on your group’s computers.

Teaching Tip
“The Search for Pixel” is available as a hosted slide experience on the first level within this lesson. You can also provide the slidedeck to students so that they can run it locally on their machines. It might be helpful to assign roles in the group. In a group of three, those roles might look as follows:
Driver - Responsible for clicking and navigating the group; 
Narrator - Reads important directions and clues that pop up on the screen
Scribe - Takes notes about what the team has discovered in the Activity Guide.

✅ **Do This:** Have the groups start the slideshow. Read the directions screen (as a group or whole class). Navigate to the first scene by clicking on the Round One button.

Each round will add one more scene for the students to explore as they follow the clues leading to the missing cat.




<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_12.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
Let’s work through the first scene together– Pixel the Cat’s house. The owner is so upset by their missing feline that they have given you free range to explore the premises to search for clues. Within each scene there are obvious places to click – the navigation icons at the top, and the view menu. But many times there are also hidden hotspots within the images themselves that will reveal clues when clicked on. We can find these hidden locations by using computer vision techniques in the scene. Let’s jump in!

🖼️ Display: The next slide with a walk through of the first scene.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_13.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
Our goal in this first scene is to find two different clues about what might have happened to Pixel. Let’s start by learning about what computer vision technique is available to us in this scene.

✅ **Do This:** Have students click around the View One, View Two, and View Three menu. This will take us to different views / locations within the scene. In this case, we are able to see different portions of the owner’s spacious backyard.

✅ **Do This:** Have students click the three question mark icon, located at the top of the image. 

🎙️ **Say:** Have volunteer(s) read about object detection and heatmaps. This is a common computer vision technique and can aid us in tracking where Pixel might have gone in the scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

✅ **Do This:** Have students click the magnifying glass  icon, located at the top of the image. 

🎙️ **Say:** Now we can see a heatmap of where Pixel the cat was identified using the computer vision technique of object detection! Let’s find where the cat liked to hang out the most, as we might find a clue there.

✅ **Do This:** Have students find the two hidden hotspots by clicking on areas on the heatmap that show Pixel was there with the greatest frequency (red areas). Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

Teaching Tip
When students click the magnifying glass icon, it will use the computer vision technique of object detection on the scene, overlaying a heatmap that shows where a cat was detected and with what frequency (red = higher frequency / yellow = lower frequency).

The first clue can be found in View Two. Students should make sure that the object detection heatmap is visible, and then should click anywhere in the red area near the pond. This will bring up the first clue - Pixel is obsessed with fish and might be somewhere near water or in a market where they sell them.

The second clue can be found in View Three.  Students should make sure that the object detection heatmap is visible, and then should click anywhere in the red area near the front gate. This will bring up the second clue – there was a catnip delivery by autonomous vehicle earlier in the day. It is possible that Pixel accidentally wandered into the vehicle and got taken for a ride!

💬 **Discuss:** What computer vision technique was useful to examine this scene?

**Discussion Goal:** The computer vision technique used is object recognition with frequency being displayed with a heatmap.

💬 **Discuss:** Based on the data gathered from using computer vision, what conclusions might we draw about where Pixel might be?

**Discussion Goal:** The clues suggest that we might want to investigate someplace where fish might be sold, or to investigate the autonomous delivery vehicles in the area.



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_15.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🖼️ Display: Round One Recap. Answer any questions about how the activity is run before proceeding to the next round.  

✅ **Do This:** Students should copy over information about object recognition and about the two clues into their Activity Guide if they were not able to document this information earlier.



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_16.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
We have two solid leads to go on now thanks to the ability to use the computer vision technique called object detection. Way to go, digital detectives! Let’s begin Round Two of the activity. Click the Map icon at the top of the image in order to navigate back to the Main Map of the city. Click the Round Two button in order to reveal a new location on our map. 
This is the Riverside Open Market, a hustling and bustling area, known for selling all sorts of foods that might attract a cat– including 46 different types of fish! The owner of the market has recently installed self-composting trash bins. They are equipped with a safety mechanism that uses computer vision technology in order to make sure that no living creatures are inside of the can before beginning a compost cycle. The owner has let us know that three of the self-composting bins have detected something strange inside and that we are free to investigate whether or not it might be Pixel seeking an aquatic treat.

✅ **Do This:** Have students navigate to Round Two. Here, they should click on the food cart icon to be brought to the Riverside Open Market scene.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_17.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

✅ **Do This:** Groups should click the three question mark icon first to learn about the computer vision technique they will be employing in this scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are three views in this scene. Each view contains one composting can. They should click the can in the image in order to “look inside”. Once they are looking inside, they should click the magnifying glass icon to use feature detection.  (5 min)

Teaching Tip
In this scene, the students will see that feature detection is used to look for the shape of eyes in the contents of the self-composting trash bins. The clue that students are looking for is found in the View Three. If they click on the composting bin (located on the middle-right side of the image), and then click the magnifying glass icon to use feature detection, they will find the clue. There is a cat in the bin, but it isn’t Pixel.



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_18.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

💬 **Discuss:** How does feature detection work in this instance?

**Discussion Goal:** Computer vision applications can be trained to recognize certain features within an image– based on points, edges, curves, shapes, or a combination of all of these. Eyes can be identified as an oval shape with internal circles.

💬 **Discuss:** Were there places where the confidence ratings were more or less helpful than others?

**Discussion Goal:** There was one piece of trash in the second bin that resemble peaches with two circle features put side-by-side. This is also reminiscent of the shape of eyes, and therefore, is more likely to confuse a computer vision application. You can see that here by the higher than usual confidence rating (45%)



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_19.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
That lead turned out to be a bust. That’s alright though; following leads until they work out or fizzle is part of a detective’s job. Let’s begin Round Three of the activity. Click the Map icon at the top of the image in order to navigate back to the Main Map of the city. Click the Round Three button in order to reveal a new location on our map. 
We have now caught up with the autonomous vehicle that made the catnip delivery to Pixel’s house earlier. If Pixel was inside, then she might have gotten out at one of the other delivery points. The door of the vehicle can’t open while it is in motion, so that rules out a lot of locations (luckily!). Explore the two other delivery points in order to see if we can find Pixel or clues to her whereabouts.

✅ **Do This:** Have students navigate to Round Three. Here, they should click on the vehicle icon to be brought to the Autonomous Delivery Vehicle scene.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_20.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

✅ **Do This:** Groups should click the three question mark icon first to learn about the computer vision technique they will be employing in this scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are three views in this scene– two in the menu, and one hidden view. The computer vision technique used by the autonomous vehicle is segmentation. When students click on the magnifying glass icon, the scene will be segmented and color-coded based on what features were identified. Students can click the menu that appears on the left-hand side in order to isolate different segments.  (5 min)

Teaching Tip
In this scene, the students will see image segmentation – this is a way for autonomous vehicles to quickly make sense of the their surroundings. One of the segmentation categories is “unknown”. If students click this, they will see the outline of a cat in both views. The segmented image of the cat is a hotspot; students can click it to find the clue in the scene. 
After they find the clue in View Two, there is “Breaking News!” that appears on the screen. This additional information tells the students that the delivery vehicles actually made a third stop at the delivery warehouse in order to quickly charge its batteries. They can now go back to the Delivery Route Map and click on a secret hotspot (the location revealed in the Breaking News; located below the 4th directional arrow on the map) that will reveal the scene’s clue.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_21.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

💬 **Discuss:** How does image segmentation help an autonomous vehicle make important decisions?

**Discussion Goal:** Segmentation algorithms allow autonomous vehicles to classify and color code different road conditions and objects, making a complex image or video into an easy to understand map of colors. The data from the vehicle’s cameras is converted into usable information that can help the vehicle navigate effectively. It allows the vehicle to perceive its surroundings quickly without focusing too much on irrelevant details.

💬 **Discuss:** What other useful information might be helpful to segment for an autonomous vehicle?

**Discussion Goal:** Answers will vary. Students might suggest separating traffic lights from traffic signs; construction materials / markers; bicycles; potholes, etc.



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_22.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
We found a lead! It definitely looks like Pixel was in the delivery vehicle and got out at the hub where the vehicle went to charge its batteries. We are getting close to finding her now! Let’s begin Round Four of the activity. Click the Map icon at the top of the image in order to navigate back to the Main Map of the city. Click the Round Four button in order to reveal a new location on our map. 
This is the main hub for all of the autonomous vehicles in the city. There are autonomous delivery vehicles and autonomous cabs, all ferrying items and people around the city, driven solely by computer vision and complex algorithms. This hub is a busy place with lots of coming and going. Without a way to sort through the mass of movement and activity, it will be difficult to find out what happened to Pixel once she got there.

✅ **Do This:** Have students navigate to Round Four.  Here, they should click on the vehicle icon to be brought to the Autonomous Vehicle Hub scene.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_23.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

✅ **Do This:** Groups should click the three question mark icon first to learn about the computer vision technique they will be employing in this scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are two views in this scene. The computer vision technique used by the autonomous vehicle is anomaly filtering. When students click on the magnifying glass icon, a new UI element will appear on the image. It will allow the student to click a knob and shift it from the normal image, to a heatmap of common movements, to a heatmap that contains filtered anomalous movements.  (5 min)

Teaching Tip
In this scene, the students use anomaly detection. Using computer vision along with machine learning, each view is analyzed to see the common movements of the vehicles over time. This builds up a memory of where vehicles tend to move and travel and where they do not. By filtering out the common movements, we can see anomalies. This accounts for movements that don’t normally occur– like when a random cat wanders across the scene. 
In View Two, students can find the hidden hotspot that will reveal the clue by displaying the hotpot map of anomalous movement. The hotspot is the open door to the van. This shows that Pixel wandered from one vehicle to another, and now we need to track down this autonomous cab as it picks up passengers around the city.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_24.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

💬 **Discuss:** How does filtering anomalies from predicted movement patterns provide useful data?

**Discussion Goal:** Anomalies in movement data can show interesting patterns that might not always be visible. It is necessary to train a model to recognize what is considered normal movement before you can identify anomalies.

💬 **Discuss:** What other applications of finding anomalies might be useful?

**Discussion Goal:** Answers will vary. Students might suggest migrations of animals, traffic in a busy city, pedestrian movement, etc. 


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_25.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
It seems as though Pixel might be cruising around the city in an autonomous cab. This cat is on the move!  Let’s begin Round Five of the activity. Click the Map icon at the top of the image in order to navigate back to the Main Map of the city. Click the Round Five button in order to reveal several new locations on our map. 
Since we know the cab that Pixel was hitching a ride in, we can use the data from the city’s traffic cameras in order to track the vehicle and to see where it might have gone. The only problem is that millions of vehicles pass by these cameras every day… hopefully there is a computer vision solution that will allow us to hone in on the information we need without having to spend an eternity searching for it…

✅ **Do This:** Have students navigate to Round Five.  Here, they should click on the vehicle icon to be brought to the Autonomous Vehicle Hub scene.



<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_26.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

✅ **Do This:** Groups should click the three question mark icon first to learn about the computer vision technique they will be employing in this scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are seven different traffic cameras in this scene. The computer vision technique used to make sense of the data is license plate readers.  (5 min)

Teaching Tip
In this scene, will explore the seven different traffic camera views. Each of these cameras took images from passing cars, converted the characters from the license plates into a text file, and marked key additional data about the scene like the date, the time, and the location. In this way, detectives can quickly sort through millions of vehicle trips and focus in on specific vehicles that they are looking for. By examining the accompanying camera feed images they can see that the cat was indeed present in the cab during some of its trips. This will lead us to our final destination – the college football stadium– where it looks as though Pixel got out to join the ruckus.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_27.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

💬 **Discuss:** How did examining the data from license plate readers help us to track down Pixel?

**Discussion Goal:** Each of these cameras took images from passing cars, converted the characters from the license plates into a text file, and marked key additional data about the scene like the date, the time, and the location. We can quickly sort through millions of vehicle trips and focus in on specific vehicles. Then by examining the accompanying camera feed images, we can see that the cat was indeed present in the cab during some of its trips.

💬 **Discuss:** Who or what might have an interest in data gathered from these sources?

**Discussion Goal:** Answers will vary. Students might suggest scientists that are studying urban traffic patterns; the FBI / CIA / local law enforcement agencies; vehicle manufacturers; autonomous vehicle companies, etc.


<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

🎙Remarks
We might not have known that Pixel was a college sports fan, but we certainly know now! She got out of the autonomous cab near the local stadium.  Let’s begin Round Six of the activity– the final round! Click the Map icon at the top of the image in order to navigate back to the Main Map of the city. 
Since there are many thousands of people in the stadium, finding one cat might prove to be impossible. However, part of being a detective is following your hunches. If you remember hearing correctly, this was one of the only stadiums in the country that is pioneering a special fish-flavored hot dog. It’s not popular YET, but the manufacturer is hoping that it will take off. At this time, there is only one vendor in the whole stadium that is selling this delicacy– Frank the fishy frankfurter salesman. Can you find Frank (and maybe Pixel) before the 4th quarter winds down and the crowd disperses? Time is running out!

✅ **Do This:** Have students navigate to Round Six.  Here, they should click on the stadium icon to be brought to the College Football Stadium scene.




<hr style="border: 5px solid black;" />

<img src="https://jamjamgobambam.github.io/curriculum-drafts/slide-images/computer-vision/1iRjA-LRoorYZdqIshLhOkoG-hlvcPEJScBZAz4ptjDE/slide_29.png" style="width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid black;" />

✅ **Do This:** Groups should click the three question mark icon first to learn about the computer vision technique they will be employing in this scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are two different views to explore. The computer vision technique used here is facial recognition.  (5 min)

Teaching Tip
In this scene, students will explore the two views in order to find Frank (and Pixel who has conveniently hitched a ride atop his mobile hot dog station). There are several people in the crowd that look like Frank, and so there are some false positives with the facial recognition algorithm. Students can find Frank in View Two.

💬 **Discuss:** Was the facial recognition algorithm 100% accurate all of the time?

**Discussion Goal:** The technology is not foolproof– there are many issues with it still. Sometimes facial recognition struggles to make sense of certain facial features and ethnic groups. Othertimes, there might be too many false positives. This is a technology with a lot of room for exploration and one which we will examine further in detail later in the module.

💬 **Discuss:** Is it ethical to use facial recognition technology to scan everyone who enters a large event?

**Discussion Goal:** Answers will vary. This conversation will foreshadow one that will be repeated several times throughout this module – in which students will be asked to examine the ethics behind different applications of computer vision.
