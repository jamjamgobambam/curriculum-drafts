# lesson-1







Warm Up (10 mins)


> 🎙️ **Say:** In the previous lesson, we saw a range of computer vision techniques and use cases. Over the next few lessons, we'll look more closely at some specific examples of computer vision applications. Today, we'll look at one of the companies mentioned in the video we saw before – Farmwise – which builds automated weeding technology.

🎥 **Video:** Watch the video about Farmwise together as a class, and have students think about the following guiding questions:
What specific problem does this technology help solve?
How does this technology incorporate computer vision?
Who benefits from this technology?



💬 **Discuss:** What could be an unintended negative consequence of this technology?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Use this discussion to get students to see that there are multiple sides to most things. Some topics that students might bring up or that you could prompt students to think about:
Loss of jobs for farm workers
Lack of access to this technology for smaller farms, making it harder for them to compete
Data security when it comes to farming techniques such as placement of or spacing between plants

Teaching Tip
Move on from the discussion after 5 minutes. It’s okay if these case studies bring up more questions than answers! If you find your class generating a lot of questions, you could consider capturing these in a Parking Lot or on a KWL Chart.

> 🎙️ **Say:** We will continue to look at more case studies throughout the next few lessons. For the rest of today, let’s take a look at a process that teams use to develop applications such as the one we just looked at.









Activity (25 mins)


☑️ **Do This:** Introduce the Design Thinking Process. 

> 🎙️ **Say:** The Design Thinking Process involves five steps that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. This process and the stages involved are things you’ve all done at different points in your life. As we go through this one-by-one, think about times when you’ve done something similar and write those down on your activity guide.

Teaching Tip
Design Thinking is a larger framework for creatively addressing community issues that we’ve adapted here. For more tips and background on Design Thinking, consider reading these articles here and here



> 🎙️ **Say:** These steps work together in a cycle, without a specific start, end, or direction.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Today, we'll focus on empathizing. This involves putting ourselves into the shoes of our users…


> 🎙️ **Say:** Here’s an example of how a group of designers might empathize with their users involving the company we saw in the warm up video, Farmwise: 

☑️ **Do This:** Ask a student to read the quote out loud to the rest of the class.

💬 **Discuss:** What do you think the FarmWise employees learned from interviewing farmers about the difficulties they faced?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** You’ll return to some possible examples for this later in the lesson, so for this discussion, try to encourage as wide a range of possibilities as possible instead of going into depth on any one idea.




📄 **Distribute:** Give each student a copy of the Communities I Belong To activity guide.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Next, we are going to start the process of being designers ourselves. To start the process, we need to figure out who we are designing for, which involves finding a community with a need. To help with this, we are all going to brainstorm a list of communities that we belong to in our Unit Guides. Here is an example of how this brainstorm might look:

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** These can be general communities related to characteristics such as age…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Interests…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Location…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Pets…

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** Or any number of other characteristics. A community can be however you define it, so feel free to include any community you belong to.



☑️ **Do This:** Give students a few minutes to complete the Communities I Belong To activity guide.





☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to participate in a Give One, Get One. Use the musical cue on the slides to facilitate the timing of students walking around the room to share responses with each other.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Next, we are going to practice turning observations about problems facing a community into questions that will allow us to gather more information about our users’ needs. For this, let’s return to the example of FarmWise employees volunteering on farms and interviewing farmers.

We already discussed some things that the FarmWise employees might have learned from their interviews. Let’s break down the process of gathering that information a little bit more, starting with some observations that the designers might have made while volunteering as a part of the farming community: 
Lack of access to enough water
Trouble finding enough workers to hire
Challenges minimizing the loss of crops due to pests and disease. 

These problems and the needs associated with them might be obvious to members of the community, but as designers, our job is to find out more about what our users need instead of making assumptions. To do this, we need to dig a bit deeper by talking with users, just like the FarmWise employees interviewed farmers.

Turning these observations into research questions will help you as a designer gather more data about your users and help you more clearly define the problem you are trying to solve.

Here is an example of a question that the employees at FarmWise might have asked to learn more about the issue of water scarcity. Can you think of questions they might ask about labor shortages or pest and disease management?

☑️ **Do This:** Give students a minute to process and brainstorm possible questions before asking a few students to share possible questions.

Teaching Tip
You may choose to use examples from the class discussion earlier in place of the ones provided on the slide if you think those are issues that your class will better understand and resonate with.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Nice job coming up with questions of your own! Here are other examples of questions that might have been helpful. Notice that most of them are framed in an open-ended way, asking the user to describe experiences they’ve had.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Soon, we will get into groups to work on developing research questions. Before we do, we will establish roles for when we collaborate. For today, you will work in groups of 3, with each person playing a different role. 

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the timekeeper. This person is in charge of making sure the group stays on time with each chunk of work. 

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the scribe. This person is in charge of recording key points from discussions and documenting the group’s work. 

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** One person will be the Task Manager. This person is in charge of making sure the group understands the task at hand and keeps the group on task throughout the work. 

Having specific roles in a group helps us work together smoothly, just like in real jobs where everyone has a special role to make big projects succeed. Think of working in a group like being on a movie set: everyone has a specific job to do. Just like a director guides a movie and a sound engineer captures the best audio, each role helps us tackle tasks more effectively, improving our collaboration skills.



Group: Place students into groups of 3.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group a copy of Problem Observations → Research Questions activity guide.


☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to complete the Problem Observations → Research Question activity guide.

🔁 **Circulate:** As groups work together, walk around the room to observe and listen to how students are doing with group roles, noting anything you’d like to bring up as during the wrap up.



Wrap Up (10 mins)


☑️ **Do This:**  Direct students to move to a part of the room where they can gather with all of the other people who played the same role as them.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct groups to discuss the two prompts. Have each group share out their one piece of advice to the whole class and add in any of your own observations that you think are worth including.

Teaching Tip
The share outs from this wrap-up could make for the start of a useful classroom anchor chart on group roles and advice for people using those roles.

🖼️ Display: Question of the Day



💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 2, Levels 1 and 2 to complete the reflection questions.
Describe a community you belong to and a potential problem within that community that you discussed with your group.
What was one research question you wrote down to learn more about the users' needs and why would that be important to learn about?

💡 Reflection Goal:  
This question aims to assess students' ability to connect their personal experiences with the broader scope of computer vision applications, encouraging them to think critically about how technology can serve diverse needs.
The goal here is to evaluate students' understanding of how to translate observations about a community's challenges into open-ended questions that can effectively guide user research and data gathering.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
The responses in the levels can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
