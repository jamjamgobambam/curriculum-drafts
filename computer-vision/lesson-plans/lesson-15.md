# Lesson 15

## Warm Up (10 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** Today, we'll explore how design thinking is inherently iterative, requiring us to adapt to user feedback. Let's warm up with a fun, rapid redesign activity.

**Group:** Place students in pairs or small groups of 3.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each pair an everyday object.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Your challenge is to quickly brainstorm an improvement to make it better or more interesting

☑️ **Do This:** Give students two minutes (a timer has been provided for your use), to quickly brainstorm ideas and deduce on one way to improve the design.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Alright teams, you've been brainstorming some fantastic improvements to your everyday objects. Now, let's introduce a twist to truly test the flexibility of your design thinking. You will now receive a new constraint for your object. This constraint represents unexpected feedback or a challenge that your design must now accommodate. Remember, great innovations often come from overcoming unexpected hurdles. Let's see how you can adapt your original ideas to meet these new conditions. Embrace this challenge as an opportunity to think outside the box and further refine your designs.

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce the list of constraints to simulate receiving new user feedback one at a time.

🔁 **Circulate:** Ensure all students are participating and that groups are considering the usability and practicality of their designs in light of the introduced constraints.

**Teaching Tip**

If you have time, consider asking groups to either share their ideas to incorporate the new constraints with another group or with the class as a whole at the end of this activity.
{% endhint %}

💬 **Discuss:** _How did the introduction of a new constraint affect your original design?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Encourage students to articulate the specific ways in which the new constraint challenged their initial design concepts. The aim is to highlight adaptability and creative problem-solving skills in the face of unforeseen challenges, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the design process. If you have time, you can also extend this conversation to discuss the ways the new design is better as a whole after adapting for the one constraint - for example, their pencil that is now usable under water may also be harder to break while not under water as well!

💬 **Discuss:** _What does this teach us about the importance of being open to feedback in the design process?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Prompt students to reflect on the value of feedback in refining and improving a design. This discussion should emphasize how being receptive to feedback, even when it introduces new challenges or constraints, is crucial for achieving more versatile, effective, and user-centered solutions.

## Activity (30 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** Our main task today is to dive into the feedback you received on your computer vision prototypes during the previous lesson. This is a crucial step in the design thinking process where we learn to evaluate and prioritize feedback to make our projects even better.

📄 **Distribute:** If you kept each group’s User Feedback sheets, pass those back out to each group. Give each group approximately 8-10 sticky notes. If you are able to provide each group with 4 different colors (one for each category they will be using to classify their feedback), that would be ideal, but not necessary. Each group will also need a large poster paper for categorizing their feedback.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

You can also direct students to use a digital platform, such as Google Slides, Miro, Figma, or something else you are familiar with instead of the poster paper.
{% endhint %}

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to divide their posters into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Will Not Have. Explain how by categorizing their feedback, they can prioritize their design efforts effectively, ensuring that essential improvements are addressed first while managing resources and time constraints - essentially, it will help them focus their efforts during the prototype iteration.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Must Have feedback are the ones that are critical for your prototype’s functionality or success. These are non-negotiable improvements that need to be included in your next iteration.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Must Have” might be.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Should Have feedback would be important features or changes that would significantly benefit the prototype but are not as critical as 'Must Haves.' These should be included if time and resources permit.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Should Have” might be.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Could Have would be features that would be 'Nice to have' that would enhance the prototype but have a lesser impact compared to 'Must Haves' and 'Should Haves.' These are optional and dependent on available resources.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Could Have” might be.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Finally, your “Will Not Have” feedback will be those that, while potentially valuable, do not align with the project’s scope, goals, or user needs at this time. These are not planned for inclusion in the foreseeable future.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Will Not Have” might be.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to summarize their feedback.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to place their sticky notes into the sections they believe they belong.

> 🎙️ **Say:** With your user feedback freshly organized, it's time to put that valuable insight into action. In this Iteration Sprint, you'll make focused changes to your prototypes. Remember, quick decisions and creativity are key here. First, review the feedback you put in the “Must Have” section of your poster. Take a couple of minutes to identify the most critical areas for improvement - for example, might identify the the design elements in general based on the fact that you have several pieces of feedback that all relate to that area.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to review the prioritized feedback in the “Must Have” section of their poster, identifying the most crucial areas for improvement.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Now that you’ve identified the most crucial areas for improvement - perhaps it is the user interface layout as the general area in need of improvement, for example, you will now take a couple of minutes to decide which specific feature about that general area that is the most critical for this sprint's focus. Quick decisions will set the pace for productive updates!

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to decide which specific item they will address in this rapid redesign sprint.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to individually sketch or write down ideas for incorporating the selected feedback they will be incorporating into their prototype.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss their ideas and try to reach a consensus on the best approach to their rapid redesign.

🔁 **Circulate:** Ensure all group members are contributing ideas and actively participating in the iteration process.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to implement their agreed-upon changes to their prototype’s rapid redesign.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, check that students are not just making modifications but are incorporating user feedback in meaningful ways. Remind students to keep the user's needs and experiences at the forefront of their iteration process, ensuring that updates enhance usability and user satisfaction.

💬 **Discuss:** _What was the most actionable feedback your group received? How did it influenced your prototype's improvements?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Encourage students to articulate the specific feedback that had a significant impact on their design process, demonstrating the direct connection between user input and design evolution. This discussion aims to highlight the practical application of feedback in enhancing product functionality and user experience, fostering a deeper appreciation for the iterative nature of design thinking and more importantly, allow students to see that the feedback that they give can be powerful and affect change.

💬 **Discuss:** _What is one piece of feedback you didn't get to change this time, but you would like to change in the future if given the chance? Why did it stand out and how could it shape your prototype's next development phase?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Encourage students to reflect on and articulate why certain pieces of feedback resonated with them and how these insights could influence the direction of their project's development. This aims to cultivate a forward-thinking mindset, recognizing the value of all feedback—not just immediate changes but also ideas that spark innovation for future iterations.

💬 **Discuss:** _How has the feedback you've given and received during this project served as a catalyst for change? What does this reveal about the power of constructive feedback in the design process?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Prompt students to evaluate the transformative effect of both giving and receiving feedback throughout their project, understanding its critical role in driving improvements and fostering innovation. This discussion aims to highlight the value of constructive feedback in challenging assumptions, inspiring new ideas, and advancing the design process, reinforcing the concept that feedback is an essential tool for growth and development in any creative endeavor.

## Wrap Up (5 mins)

💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Level 1 to complete their reflection questions on Levels 1, 2, and 3.

* _Reflect on the iteration process of your prototype. What aspects of this process did you find most effective in improving your design, and why do you think these elements were particularly successful?_
* _Describe a specific instance where implementing feedback was challenging. What was the feedback, why was it difficult to implement, and how did you address the challenge?_
* _What have you learned about the process of collecting, evaluating, and acting on feedback throughout this project? How will this learning influence your approach to future projects?_

💡 **Reflection Goals:** This question encourages students to analyze and articulate which parts of the iteration process contributed most significantly to their prototype's development, fostering an understanding of effective design practices. Students should provide clear examples of successful iteration elements, such as rapid prototyping, user testing sessions, or specific types of feedback that were particularly insightful along with an explanation of why these elements were effective. This question encourages students to reflect on the difficulties encountered in implementing feedback and discuss the strategies or compromises made to navigate these challenges while still striving to meet user needs. This question aims to explore what students have gleaned from their experiences with feedback, emphasizing the importance of feedback in design and how it shapes their approach to projects.
