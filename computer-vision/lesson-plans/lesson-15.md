> 🎙️ **Say:** Today, we'll explore how design thinking is inherently iterative, requiring us to adapt to user feedback. Let's warm up with a fun, rapid redesign activity

☑️ **Do This:** Divide students into groups of 2-3 and distribute one everyday object to each group. 



> 🎙️ **Say:** Your challenge is to quickly brainstorm an improvement to make it better or more interesting

☑️ **Do This:** Give students two minutes (a timer has been provided for your use), to quickly brainstorm ideas and deduce on one way to improve the design.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Alright teams, you've been brainstorming some fantastic improvements to your everyday objects. Now, let's introduce a twist to truly test the flexibility of your design thinking. You will now receive a new constraint for your object. This constraint represents unexpected feedback or a challenge that your design must now accommodate. Remember, great innovations often come from overcoming unexpected hurdles. Let's see how you can adapt your original ideas to meet these new conditions. Embrace this challenge as an opportunity to think outside the box and further refine your designs.

☑️ **Do This:** Introduce the list of constraints to simulate receiving new user feedback one at a time.

🔁 **Circulate:** Ensure all students are participating and that groups are considering the usability and practicality of their designs in light of the introduced constraints.

Teaching Tip: Optional Share Out
If you have time, consider asking groups to either share their ideas to incorporate the new constraints with another group or with the class as a whole at the end of this activity.







💬 **Discuss:** How did the introduction of a new constraint affect your original design?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Encourage students to articulate the specific ways in which the new constraint challenged their initial design concepts. The aim is to highlight adaptability and creative problem-solving skills in the face of unforeseen challenges, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the design process. If you have time, you can also extend this conversation to discuss the ways the new design is better as a whole after adapting for the one constraint - for example, their pencil that is now usable under water may also be harder to break while not under water as well!

💬 **Discuss:** What does this teach us about the importance of being open to feedback in the design process?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Prompt students to reflect on the value of feedback in refining and improving a design. This discussion should emphasize how being receptive to feedback, even when it introduces new challenges or constraints, is crucial for achieving more versatile, effective, and user-centered solutions.














> 🎙️ **Say:** Our main task today is to dive into the feedback you received on your CV prototypes during the previous lesson. This is a crucial step in the design thinking process where we learn to evaluate and prioritize feedback to make our projects even better.




📄 **Distribute:** If you kept each group’s User Feedback sheets, pass those back out to each group. Give each group approximately 8-10 sticky notes. If you are able to provide each group with 4 different colors (one for each category they will be using to classify their feedback), that would be ideal, but not necessary. Each group will also need a large poster paper for categorizing their feedback. 

Teaching Tip: Digital Options for Categorizing Feedback
You can also direct students to use a digital platform, such as Google Slides, Miro, Figma, or something else you are familiar with instead of the poster paper.

☑️ **Do This:** If students kept their User Feedback sheets, direct them to take those out.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to divide their posters into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Will Not Have.
Explain how by categorizing their feedback, they can prioritize their design efforts effectively, ensuring that essential improvements are addressed first while managing resources and time constraints - essentially, it will help them focus their efforts during the prototype iteration.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Must Have feedback are the ones that are critical for your prototype’s functionality or success. These are non-negotiable improvements that need to be included in your next iteration.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Must Have” might be.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Should Have feedback would be important features or changes that would significantly benefit the prototype but are not as critical as 'Must Haves.' These should be included if time and resources permit.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Should Have” might be.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Could Have would be features that would be 'Nice to have' that would enhance the prototype but have a lesser impact compared to 'Must Haves' and 'Should Haves.' These are optional and dependent on available resources.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Could Have” might be.




> 🎙️ **Say:** Finally, your “Will Not Have” feedback will be those that, while potentially valuable, do not align with the project’s scope, goals, or user needs at this time. These are not planned for inclusion in the foreseeable future.

☑️ **Do This:** Display the description in the slide and ask students what an example of a “Will Not Have” might be.





> 🎙️ **Say:** You and your partner will dive back into the user feedback sheets. Take the time to carefully consider each piece of feedback, engaging in thoughtful discussion to determine which category it falls into. Once you've made a decision, capture the essence of the feedback in a sentence or two on sticky notes. Feel free to use different colors for each category to visually organize your thoughts. Reflect on how each piece of feedback relates to your project's objectives and the needs of your users. Remember, the sticky notes offer you the flexibility to adjust and reorganize your priorities as your discussion evolves.

Teaching Tip: Slide Purpose
This slide is meant to help you describe the process of the Foray into User Feedback to your students. There is a slide with a concise summary of the task found on slide 20.



> 🎙️ **Say:**As you begin to place each sticky note into the section you feel it best fits, you might discover new insights or see patterns emerge that prompt you to reconsider your initial categorizations. This is a natural and valuable part of the process. It's entirely okay to move sticky notes around as your understanding deepens and your discussions progress. Keep the dialogue open and dynamic, allowing your thoughts and decisions to evolve. The goal is to ensure that by the end of this activity, you are confident and satisfied with where all your feedback has been placed. This iterative discussion and reevaluation are crucial for truly understanding the feedback and how it can inform your next steps.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment
The categorized user feedback can be used as a formative assessment of student’s ability to categorize feedback.


☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to get started going through their user feedback, discussing each piece of feedback, categorizing the feedback, summarize the feedback onto a sticky note and then organize the feedback on their poster into the four categories.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you move among the groups offer guidance on interpreting feedback and making thoughtful decisions about categorization.





> 🎙️ **Say:** With your user feedback freshly organized, it's time to put that valuable insight into action. In this Iteration Sprint, you'll make focused changes to your prototypes. Remember, quick decisions and creativity are key here. First, review the feedback you put in the “Must Have” section of your poster. Take a couple of minutes to identify the most critical areas for improvement - for example, might identify the the design elements in general based on the fact that you have several pieces of feedback that all relate to that area.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to review the prioritized feedback in the “Must Have” section of their poster, identifying the most crucial areas for improvement.


> 🎙️ **Say:** Now that you’ve identified the most crucial areas for improvement - perhaps it is the user interface layout as the general area in need of improvement, for example, you will now take a couple of minutes to decide which specific feature about that general area that is the most critical for this sprint's focus. Quick decisions will set the pace for productive updates!

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to decide which specific item they will address in this rapid redesign sprint.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Now, dive into silent brainstorming. Sketch or jot down your individual ideas for weaving the selected feedback into your prototype. Remember, there are no wrong ideas at this stage, just opportunities for innovation.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to individually sketch or write down ideas for incorporating the selected feedback they will be incorporating into their prototype.



> 🎙️ **Say:** Time to share your brainstormed ideas with your partner. Listen to each other and work towards agreeing on the best approach. This step is all about merging diverse perspectives into a unified strategy for your prototype.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss their ideas and try to reach a consensus on the best approach to their rapid redesign.

🔁 **Circulate:** Ensure all group members are contributing ideas and actively participating in the iteration process.


> 🎙️ **Say:** With a plan in place, it's time to update your prototype. Collaborate closely, ensuring that everyone's contributions move the project forward. These next few minutes are crucial for turning feedback into tangible improvements.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to implement their agreed-upon changes to their prototype’s rapid redesign.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, check that students are not just making modifications but are incorporating user feedback in meaningful ways. Remind students to keep the user's needs and experiences at the forefront of their iteration process, ensuring that updates enhance usability and user satisfaction.
