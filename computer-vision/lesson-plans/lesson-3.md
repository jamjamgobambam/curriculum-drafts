# Lesson 3

## Overview (Teacher)

**How can we collect data that helps us better understand our users?**

In this lesson, students learn the difference between qualitative data, the information you can measure with numbers and quantitative data, information that uses words rather than numbers, before using that knowledge to iterate on the questions they will ask users. For the rest of the class, students spend time gathering user data. The groups will use the data collected over the following two lessons to develop user personas and issue statements to guide the design of their application.

## Overview (Students)

You and your group will continue to develop the questions you will ask your users and then spend the rest of the class surveying potential users of your application.

🎙️ **Say:** As you watch this video, think about these two questions. Remember there are no right or wrong answers here!

🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Computer Vision - Workout Tracking App"

Teaching Tip: Replay Video This video clip is quite short so it could be worth playing it a second time and asking students to see if they can notice something new the second time through.

💬 **Discuss:** What do you notice? What do you wonder?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This is just to get students sharing about details they notice from the video (the dots on the body parts, the labels and numbers on the left hand side of the screen, etc). Anything shared in the “What do you wonder?” section doesn’t need to be addressed here and can be useful information to inform connections that can be made later.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Various home fitness devices that “watch the user’s form and employs dots to plot the user’s movements, locating their muscles and joints to ensure each lift, squat, and slide is done properly.” You can see in this image that based on the movements tracked, the device can give feedback on movements such as a squat.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Yesterday, we examined the question about who benefits, and today we will add in one more question. This question deals with ethical implications, which can range from issues around fairness, privacy, and security.

💬 **Discuss:** With a partner: Describe two possible users of this type of fitness device Brainstorm possible privacy issues that could arise from this application

🔁 **Circulate:** As students are discussing in pairs, listen for descriptions of a variety of users that you can pull out during the whole group discussion.

💡 **Discussion Goal:** For the first question, push students to see there are differences between users of the same application. While someone might be using it to train for a specific sport, someone else may be using it to rehabilitate from an accident.

For the second question, there may be more questions generated than answers and that’s ok. Students haven’t been given much detail about how this application works or was trained, so they may ask questions that won’t be answered here. Some students may wonder if the users whose data it was trained on were aware that they would be training this sort of trainer, what sort of data about each users body is being collected by the device, or if the data the device collects is used to train future AI models.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Today we will continue to work on the first step in the process Empathizing …

Empathizing can be a challenge without adequate information. Today, we’ll take steps to gather more information from our users so that we, as designers, can better empathize with them and understand their needs.

> 🎙️ **Say:** To start, let’s think about different types of information. Starting with, consider the situation of looking at a social media profile or post. What kinds of information can we gather from these sources?

☑️ **Do This:** Give students 1-2 minutes to write down as many pieces of information as they can.

🔁 **Circulate:** As students are writing, look for both qualitative (ex: comments on posts, profile bio) and quantitative (ex: number of likes, followers) responses, so that you can make sure to highlight some of both if needed.

> 🎙️ **Say:** When we look at information or data, it can be useful to distinguish between qualitative, descriptive information using words, and quantitative, information you can measure.

✏️ **Vocabulary:** Qualitative Data is a type of information that describes things using words rather than numbers

Quantitative Data is information you can count or measure with numbers.

💬 **Discuss:** Pick one of the pieces of information you just listed. Which category does it belong to?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Use this discussion to get a sense of how comfortable your students are with making this distinction.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment After some students have shared out, you may choose to pick out a piece of information that hasn’t been shared yet and ask students to vote with a hand signal if they think it’s a piece of qualitative (closed fist) or quantitative (open palm).

📄 **Distribute:** If you collected the Lesson 2 - Problem Observations → Research Questions, pass these back to students for reference for this part of class.

💬 **Discuss:** Which of the questions you brainstormed yesterday will lead to: Qualitative data? 💭 Quantitative data? 🔢 How many of each type of question do you have?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** It’s likely that groups will have questions that lead to qualitative data since most of the examples from Lesson 2 fell into this category. That sets up the motivation for the next slide, which supports students in revising questions.

> 🎙️ **Say:** When we survey our users, it’s important to get a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. So, if you need to revise any of your questions to turn them from one category to another or want to brainstorm some noe, here are som

☑️ **Do This:** Leave this slide up during the PBL section of the lesson.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group of students a copy of the Collecting Data From Users activity guide.

> 🎙️ **Say:** For the rest of class, your job as a group is to finalize your survey questions, create your survey, and distribute the survey to your users.

☑️ **Do This:** Make sure to review the next slide before releasing students to start working in groups

💬 **Discuss:** What are some of the challenges involved in collecting useful data from users? What steps can you take in the future to overcome these challenges the next time you want to get useful data from your users?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Since students will be testing their prototypes with users later in the module, this discussion and the takeaways from it could be useful to document somewhere like a poster that can be visible for the rest of the unit.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss their experiences with the models they just created and tested. Students can refer to their CV Design Document to see some guiding questions that will help them evaluate their models.

🎙️ Remarks: Your model will be the first component of a larger prototype that you will be designing and building out over the next few class sessions. From here, what you create and how you create it will be the decision of the group. As we build on to our prototypes, we will learn more about some of the options that are available to us, and the various forms that it might take. This Teachable Machine model is a great first step in prototyping!

> 🎙️ **Say:** We will be moving from Ideating …

🟡 Click the animation

> 🎙️ **Say:** … to Prototyping today as we work with making models in Teachable Machine.

As you ideated with your group members, you came up with lots of impressive ideas. Prototyping involves taking the most promising of these ideas and making something tangible with it. We will not be creating a whole product, rather we will be creating parts of it so that it can be tested with our users. Prototypes are intended to be quick representations of what our ideas can look like – they are not perfected final versions. The more ideas that we have and which we are able to incorporate into our prototype, the better data our testing will give at the end of the process.
