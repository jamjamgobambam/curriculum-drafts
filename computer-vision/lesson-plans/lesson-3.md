# Lesson 3

## Warm Up (10 mins)

🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Computer Vision - Workout Tracking App"

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

Replay Video This video clip is quite short so it could be worth playing it a second time and asking students to see if they can notice something new the second time through.
{% endhint %}

💬 **Discuss:** _What do you notice? What do you wonder?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This is just to get students sharing about details they notice from the video (the dots on the body parts, the labels and numbers on the left hand side of the screen, etc). Anything shared in the “What do you wonder?” section doesn’t need to be addressed here and can be useful information to inform connections that can be made later.

💬 **Discuss:** _Describe two possible users of this type of fitness device Brainstorm possible privacy issues that could arise from this application._

💡 **Discussion Goal:** For the first question, push students to see there are differences between users of the same application. While someone might be using it to train for a specific sport, someone else may be using it to rehabilitate from an accident.

For the second question, there may be more questions generated than answers and that’s ok. Students haven’t been given much detail about how this application works or was trained, so they may ask questions that won’t be answered here. Some students may wonder if the users whose data it was trained on were aware that they would be training this sort of trainer, what sort of data about each users body is being collected by the device, or if the data the device collects is used to train future AI models.

🔁 **Circulate:** As students are discussing in pairs, listen for descriptions of a variety of users that you can pull out during the whole group discussion.

## Activity (25 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** Today we will continue to work on empathizing. Empathizing can be a challenge without adequate information. Today, we’ll take steps to gather more information from our users so that we, as designers, can better empathize with them and understand their needs.

> 🎙️ **Say:** To start, let’s think about different types of information. Starting with, consider the situation of looking at a social media profile or post. What kinds of information can we gather from these sources?

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to write down all of the pieces of information they could learn about a user by looking at their social media profile and looking at one of their social media posts.

🔁 **Circulate:** As students are writing, look for both qualitative (ex: comments on posts, profile bio) and quantitative (ex: number of likes, followers) responses, so that you can make sure to highlight some of both if needed.

💬 **Discuss:** _Pick one of the pieces of information you just listed. Which category does it belong to?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Use this discussion to get a sense of how comfortable your students are with making this distinction.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Assessment Opportunity**

After some students have shared out, you may choose to pick out a piece of information that hasn’t been shared yet and ask students to vote with a hand signal if they think it’s a piece of qualitative (closed fist) or quantitative (open palm).
{% endhint %}

💬 **Discuss:** _Which of the questions you brainstormed need: Qualitative data? Quantitative data?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** It’s likely that groups will have questions that lead to qualitative data since most of the examples from Lesson 2 fell into this category. That sets up the motivation for the next slide, which supports students in revising questions.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group of students a copy of the Collecting Data From Users activity guide. If you collected the Lesson 2 - Problem Observations → Research Questions, pass these back to students for reference for this part of class.

> 🎙️ **Say:** For the rest of class, your job as a group is to finalize your survey questions, create your survey, and distribute the survey to your users.

> 🎙️ **Say:** When we survey our users, it’s important to get a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. So, if you need to revise any of your questions to turn them from one category to another or want to brainstorm some new ones, here are some question stems to get you started.

## Wrap Up (10 mins)

💬 **Discuss:** _What are some of the challenges involved in collecting useful data from users?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Since students will be testing their prototypes with users later in the module, this discussion and the takeaways from it could be useful to document somewhere like a poster that can be visible for the rest of the unit.

💬 **Discuss:** _What steps can you take in the future to overcome these challenges the next time you want to get useful data from your users?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Since students will be testing their prototypes with users later in the module, this discussion and the takeaways from it could be useful to document somewhere like a poster that can be visible for the rest of the unit.

💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Level 1 to complete their reflection question.

* _Reflecting on today's lesson, how do qualitative and quantitative data each contribute to understanding user needs in computer vision applications?_

💡 **Reflection Goal:** This question is designed to synthesize learning, asking students to consider how different types of data offer complementary insights into user needs, preferences, and behaviors, thereby informing more empathetic and effective design solutions.

**Assessment Opportunity**

The responses in the level can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
