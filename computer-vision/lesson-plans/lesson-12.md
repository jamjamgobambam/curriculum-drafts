# Lesson 12

## Warm Up (10 mins)

> 🎙️ **Say:** We have already created a sample model using Teachable Machine that might be used in our computer vision application, and today we will expand our prototypes to include other ways to show our users what our design might offer them.

🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Design Thinking: Prototype" (0:33 to 1:48)

💬 **Discuss:** _The video describes three reasons for creating a prototype. Which one do you find most compelling?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Get students to use their own words to describe and define these reasons from the video.

In the case that no students raise their hands for some of the choices here is how you can summarize those points: One, to explore what is possible– sometimes it is difficult to know what is possible without trying it; a prototype is a low stakes way of assessing possibilities. Two, to inspire your users– seeing is believing. Without putting some form of a product into a user’s hands, it might be difficult to convey the true depth of the experience. And third, to converse– to begin a dialogue about how the product can solve a key problem for users. The prototype can begin a conversation with users that will lead to further development and iteration, which often only makes the solution stronger in the end.

🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Design Thinking: Prototype" (1:49 to 2:54)

☑️ **Do This:** Prompt students to write down their response to this question before moving on to the next slide to facilitate a Give One, Get One.

☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to participate in a Give One, Get One.

## Activity (30 mins)

💬 **Discuss:** _In addition to your Teachable Machine model, what else could you add to your prototype?_

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This is an opportunity to allow students to dream big. However, the main goal of this discussion, in addition to hearing what other groups might be considering, is to help students try to constrain the scope of the prototype. Students will often propose something more grand in scope than is possible in the time that is given to them. Therefore, trying to keep a reasonable expectation of what is expected and possible over the next two class periods is a useful discussion to engage in.

> 🎙️ **Say:** Here are some possibilities that you and your group might consider and which fit within the scope of the prototype. You might be unfamiliar with some of these ideas, but that doesn’t mean that you should count them out. A little quick research might show you that it might be the best solution to your prototyping needs.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work, you may need a jolt of inspiration to find the perfect idea for how to improve your prototype. If that’s the case, feel free to come up and use one of our Inspiration Cards! They will give you one concrete item that you can add to your prototype.

> 🎙️ **Say:** As you work with your group, we will be using a series of non-verbal communication signals in order to communicate your group’s needs. You will be receiving a stack of different color cups, with each cup symbolizing a different status. The cup that is on the top of the stack – the one most visible – will be what determines your group’s status.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each group one stack of cups containing each of the four colors.

**Assessment Opportunity**

Over the course of the two work days, you should attempt to have an assessment conference with each group. These conferences should be quick and focused, and should ideally point out only one to two aspects of the project that the group can revise in order to make it stronger. The idea is to focus on what will give them the best return on their limited time.

## Wrap Up (5 mins)

💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Level 1 to complete their reflection questions on Levels 1 and 2.

* _What part of today’s prototyping activity was most useful, interesting, or engaging for you? Explain why._
* _What does 'scope' mean in the context of project planning, and how did you determine the scope of your prototype?_

💡 **Reflection Goals:** Reading through student responses before the start of the next class will be helpful to course correct any issues or identify any students who are struggling to identify anything useful, interesting or engaging about the prototyping process and work with them to find something useful or engaging and to better address student needs on Day Two. Students should explain the concept of project scope as it relates to the features, functions, and timeline of their prototype, discussing how they decided what was feasible to accomplish within the constraints of the project.

**Assessment Opportunity**

The responses in the level can be used to formatively assess how well students have met the objectives of the lesson.
