üí¨ **Discuss:** How can developers ensure their technologies are ethically aligned with societal needs?

üí° **Discussion Goal:** Students should recognize that developers can ensure their AI technologies are ethically aligned with societal needs by adopting a multi-faceted approach that includes diverse stakeholder involvement, ethical guidelines, continuous impact assessment, and transparency.

üí¨ **Discuss:** What are some of the essential checks and controls that should be in place to protect individuals' privacy and ensure ethical use?

üí° **Discussion Goal:** Students answers may vary but they should recognize that to protect individuals' privacy and ensure the ethical use of machine learning, several essential checks and controls must be implemented which might include any of the following: Data encryption Access controls Data anonymization Ethical data acquisition Regular audits Impact assessments Compliance with regulations

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** Over the past two weeks, we've delved deep into the world of computer vision, uncovering how it sees, learns, and interprets the world around us. Today, we're going to shift our focus slightly. We know how these technologies work, but have we considered their impact? Each of you has seen firsthand the power of computer vision, but with great power comes great responsibility.

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** Today, we embark on a journey to explore not just the capabilities of computer vision technologies but also their broader implications on society, privacy, and ethics. We'll investigate how these technologies, which can recognize faces, interpret emotions, and even drive cars, touch upon crucial ethical questions. How do they affect our privacy? Can they be biased? What does security really mean in the age of AI?

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** You'll work in groups to uncover the benefits and challenges of different computer vision technologies, from the familiar facial recognition to the future of autonomous vehicles. Your mission is to create a presentation that doesn't just showcase these technologies but critically examines their role in our lives. Let‚Äôs put our detective hats on and dive in to unravel the ethical dilemmas posed by computer vision!

üìÑ **Distribute:** Give each pair of students a computer vision technology packet and have them make a copy of the graphic organizer to help guide their research.

Teaching Tip: Research If providing the information packets to your students digitally, it will be useful to ensure students are able to highlight or emphaize key points in the sources in some way.

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** As you review your informational packet with your partner, reflect on how bias could manifest in this technology and its potential impacts. Consider how your technology balances innovation with privacy rights and think about any unintended consequences its widespread adoption might have.

‚òëÔ∏è **Do This:** Direct students to work with their partner to look through their CV technology packet and use their graphic organizer to help organize their insights.

Teaching Tip: Research Depending on time, you may decide to cut the comic strip from the students‚Äô tasks and just have them collect their information on slide 3. Let students know whether or not to complete the comic strip in their graphic organizer.

üîÅ **Circulate:** Check that students are thoroughly engaging with the material in their packets, not just skimming through. Encourage them to read closely and consider the implications of what they're looking at and reading. Ensure that students are discussing their findings with their partner, sharing insights, and different perspectives. Collaboration should be constructive, with both members contributing. Finally, make sure students are effectively using the graphic organizer to synthesize information from their packets. They should be identifying the benefits as well as ethical implications, potential biases, privacy concerns, or security aspects of their assigned technology.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment Students should copy/paste slide 3 and 4 (if they did slide 4) into a shared class slide deck. This will not only allow you to use this as a formative assessment of student understanding but also provide students a source of ethical concerns and insights to refer to later if needed.

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** Now that you've gathered your insights, let's bring those into a collective context. You need to join two other groups that had the same CV technology you did and your discussions should weave together the specific examples each group found with the broader ethical questions we're exploring. This is your chance to paint a full picture of the ethical landscape surrounding your technology.

‚òëÔ∏è **Do This:** Direct students to share what they learned, discuss potential safeguards, and brainstorm ways to ensure equity and fairness.

üîÅ **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, ensure students go beyond sharing their insights and they discuss how this technology could evolve responsibly, considering the ethical and privacy concerns raised and reflect on the safeguards necessary and how we can ensure the technology promotes equity and fairness.

> üéôÔ∏è **Say:** Each group has uncovered important benefits and ethical considerations of their technology. Now, you'll distill those insights into a brief summary to share with the class. This is your opportunity to highlight your collective understanding and propose thoughtful ways to navigate the ethical landscape of your technology.

Collaborate to draft a concise summary that captures your group's collective insights. Your summary should be structured to include: A brief introduction to the technology and its key benefits. A brief summary of the ethical implications discovered by your group. Proposed approaches or solutions for navigating these ethical challenges.

‚òëÔ∏è **Do This:** Direct students to quickly prepare their summary and to select one person to share the summary with the class.

üîÅ **Circulate:** As you walk around the room ensure all group members are actively participating in the preparation process. Check that groups are effectively synthesizing their discussions into concise summaries. Groups should be identifying and agreeing on the most important points to include in their presentation.

üí¨ **Discuss:** How can society navigate the ethical challenges presented by CV technologies to ensure they benefit all members equitably?

üí° **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is to encourage students to think broadly about the roles of education, transparency, public engagement and perhaps even policy in addressing ethical challenges. This discussion aims to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary approaches, including ethics, law, and technology, in creating a framework that safeguards individual rights while fostering innovation.

üí¨ **Discuss:** What is the single most important ethical consideration that you feel needs to be made when a new Computer Vision technology is introduced? Why do you feel that way?

üí° **Discussion Goal:** This question aims to personalize the ethical considerations of computer vision technologies, prompting students to reflect on and articulate their values and priorities. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of the diverse ethical dimensions these technologies entail, such as privacy, consent, transparency, and accountability. By identifying and discussing the most pressing ethical issue from their perspective, students can explore the rationale behind ethical guidelines and the potential consequences of overlooking these considerations.

Teaching Tip: Timing The main purpose of having this class discussion is to allow students to voice their thoughts and refine their opinions. Allowing students to hear their classmate‚Äôs thoughts and ideas may help some students to better define their own opinions. However, if you are short on time, you might want to skip this class discussion and have students go straight to the Assessment Levels where they will answer the same questions.

üíª **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 11, Levels 1-3 to complete their reflection questions.

Assessment Opportunity: Formative Assessment The reflection questions can be used as a formative assessment of student learning.

‚òëÔ∏è **Do This:** Direct students to discuss with their partner. Their focus should be on brainstorming and examining the possible ethical implications as well as privacy or security concerns. This discussion could potentially lead them to discovery other concerns listed in the slide.

üéôÔ∏è Remarks: There will be full two days devoted to building a prototype of your computer vision application. ‚ÄúPrototyping‚Äù is the phase of the Design Thinking Process that comes after Ideating and involves trying to quickly build / construct / plan / dream up what your solution to your original problem statement will look like. The idea is to get something tangible into the hands of potential users so that you can get feedback and further iterate on your ideas.

The third day we will move into the ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù phase of the Design Thinking Process. The class will assume the role of one of the users that you identified and for which you created user stories. They role play their part (improv!) based on the information that you provide to them and provide feedback to you from the perspective of the that particular user.
