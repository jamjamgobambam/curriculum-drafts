# lesson-11







Warm Up (10 mins)


🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Ethics and AI" (0:00 to 1:52)

💬 **Discuss:** How can developers ensure their technologies are ethically aligned with societal needs?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students should recognize that developers can ensure their AI technologies are ethically aligned with societal needs by adopting a multi-faceted approach that includes diverse stakeholder involvement, ethical guidelines, continuous impact assessment, and transparency.




🎥 **Video:** Show the video "Ethics and AI" (1;52 to 3:27)

💬 **Discuss:** What are some of the essential checks and controls that should be in place to protect individuals' privacy and ensure ethical use?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** Students answers may vary but they should recognize that to protect individuals' privacy and ensure the ethical use of machine learning, several essential checks and controls must be implemented which might include any of the following:
Data encryption
Access controls
Data anonymization
Ethical data acquisition
Regular audits
Impact assessments
Compliance with regulations 









Activity (30 mins)


Group: Place students in pairs or small groups of 3.

📄 **Distribute:** Give each pair of students one source from within the computer vision technology information packet (Facial Recognition / Autonomous Vehicles / Health & Medical) and the Ethics Exploration activity guide.

Teaching Tip
If providing the information packets to your students digitally, it will be useful to ensure students are able to highlight or emphasize key points in the sources in some way. Every group should have a different source that they are analyzing, so that groups can later come together to share information. When they jigsaw out this information with other groups, each will have unique information and context to bring to the discussion.



💻 **Transition:** Direct students to Level 1 to choose a source. Have students complete the Ethics Exploration activity guide to document their findings.

🔁 **Circulate:** Check that students are thoroughly engaging with the material in their packets, not just skimming through. Encourage them to read closely and consider the implications of what they're looking at and reading. Ensure that students are discussing their findings with their partner, sharing insights, and different perspectives. Collaboration should be constructive, with both members contributing. Finally, make sure students are effectively using the graphic organizer to synthesize information from their packets. They should be identifying the benefits as well as ethical implications, potential biases, privacy concerns, or security aspects of their assigned technology.


☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to share what they learned, discuss potential safeguards, and brainstorm ways to ensure equity and fairness.

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room, ensure students go beyond sharing their insights and they discuss how this technology could evolve responsibly, considering the ethical and privacy concerns raised and reflect on the safeguards necessary and how we can ensure the technology promotes equity and fairness.



☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to prepare a summary and to select one person to share the summary with the class. 

🔁 **Circulate:** As you walk around the room ensure all group members are actively participating in the preparation process. Check that groups are effectively synthesizing their discussions into concise summaries. Groups should be identifying and agreeing on the most important points to include in their presentation. 



💬 **Discuss:** How can society navigate the ethical challenges presented by computer vision technologies to ensure they benefit all members equitably?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is to encourage students to think broadly about the roles of education, transparency, public engagement and perhaps even policy in addressing ethical challenges. This discussion aims to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary approaches, including ethics, law, and technology, in creating a framework that safeguards individual rights while fostering innovation.

Teaching Tip
The main purpose of having this class discussion is to allow students to voice their thoughts and refine their opinions. Allowing students to hear their classmate’s thoughts and ideas may help some students to better define their own opinions. Students will get an opportunity to answer these same questions during the Wrap Up, after having time to discuss as a class and refine their thoughts. However, if you are short on time, you might decide to skip this class discussion and have students only answer these questions during the Wrap Up. 


💬 **Discuss:** What is the single most important ethical consideration that you feel needs to be made when a new computer vision technology is introduced? Why do you feel that way?

💡 **Discussion Goal:** This question aims to personalize the ethical considerations of computer vision technologies, prompting students to reflect on and articulate their values and priorities. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of the diverse ethical dimensions these technologies entail, such as privacy, consent, transparency, and accountability. By identifying and discussing the most pressing ethical issue from their perspective, students can explore the rationale behind ethical guidelines and the potential consequences of overlooking these considerations.





☑️ **Do This:** Direct students to discuss with their partner. Their focus should be on brainstorming and examining the possible ethical implications as well as privacy or security concerns. This discussion could potentially lead them to discover other concerns listed in the slide.












💻 **Transition:** Direct student to Lesson 11, Levels 2, 3, and 4 to complete their reflection questions. 
Complete this statement: When investigating my computer vision technology, I originally thought ______. After comparing and discussing with classmates who had the same tech, I now/still think ____________, because ____________.
How can society navigate the ethical challenges presented by Computer Vision technologies to ensure they benefit all members equitably?
What is the single most important ethical consideration that you feel needs to be made when a new Computer Vision technology is introduced? Why do you feel that way?

💡 Reflection Goal:  
Completing this statement encourages students to reflect on and articulate how collaborative discussions have deepened or altered their understanding of computer vision technologies, particularly regarding their ethical, privacy, and societal implications.
