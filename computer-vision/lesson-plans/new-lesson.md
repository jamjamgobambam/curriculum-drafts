We‚Äôre going to peel back the curtain and see how computers use images &#x26; video to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world around them, turning pixels into patterns, and patterns into predictions. It‚Äôs a field of study that is ongoing, current, and with many applications now and in the near future that promise to change the way that society looks and functions.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

(2 min)<br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> A simple algorithm that students might come up with is to test whether the corners are filled in; if so, then it must be an X. They might also suggest to test to see if the lines present cross each other. The main goal of this discussion will be to highlight traditional algorithmic thinking. Throughout the module, we will contrast this method of algorithmic development by accounting for using machine learning to train computer vision applications is changing the way that traditional algorithms are developed and implemented. Teaching Tip<br>Consider having students talk to a shoulder partner for a minute or two to discuss and work out an algorithm before beginning a whole class discussion.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Why or why not? (2 min)<br><br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> If the algorithm that students came up with in the previous slide was too simplistic, it might not account for these other variations of X. However, it is important to point out that through the use of computer vision, the goal is to train a computer to recognize an ‚ÄúX‚Äù in new and novel implementations.<br><br>üéôRemarks<br>Throughout this module we will be learning how computer scientists are developing sophisticated computer vision algorithms utilizing AI and data. By training these models with loads of data, the computer itself begins to write and tweak its own algorithms to help it decode and understand what an ‚ÄúX‚Äù might be. Even if it sees a version that it has never seen before, if the training was thorough enough, it should be able to recognize the letter. That is one of the goals of computer vision: to train computers to see and interpret the world around them just like we are able to do as human beings.<br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The goal of the activity is twofold: first and foremost, students will learn about and experience various computer vision techniques; second, students will attempt to use those techniques to help solve a mystery, finding out what happened to Pixel, a beloved, but missing cat. The game is divided into 6 rounds and each should take about 5 minutes to explore and complete. Using the first round as a model for how to interact with the interface is advisable. It is also recommended that you group students in pairs or triads in order to aid in the exploration and to make it more time-efficient.<br><br>In addition to the Activity Guide, there is a teacher resource that will walk you through how to navigate each round, includiung what clues there are to be found.<br><br><br><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Let‚Äôs start by learning about what computer vision technique is available to us in this scene.<br><br>‚úÖ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students click around the View One, View Two, and View Three menu. This will take us to different views / locations within the scene. In this case, we are able to see different portions of the owner‚Äôs spacious backyard.<br><br>‚úÖ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students click the three question mark icon, located at the top of the image.<br><br>üéôÔ∏è <strong>Say:</strong> Have volunteer(s) read about object detection and heatmaps. This is a common computer vision technique and can aid us in tracking where Pixel might have gone in the scene. Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.<br><br>‚úÖ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students click the magnifying glass icon, located at the top of the image.<br><br>üéôÔ∏è <strong>Say:</strong> Now we can see a heatmap of where Pixel the cat was identified using the computer vision technique of object detection! Let‚Äôs find where the cat liked to hang out the most, as we might find a clue there.<br><br>‚úÖ <strong>Do This:</strong> Have students find the two hidden hotspots by clicking on areas on the heatmap that show Pixel was there with the greatest frequency (red areas). Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.<br><br>Teaching Tip<br>When students click the magnifying glass icon, it will use the computer vision technique of object detection on the scene, overlaying a heatmap that shows where a cat was detected and with what frequency (red = higher frequency / yellow = lower frequency).<br><br>The first clue can be found in View Two. Students should make sure that the object detection heatmap is visible, and then should click anywhere in the red area near the pond. This will bring up the first clue - Pixel is obsessed with fish and might be somewhere near water or in a market where they sell them.<br><br>The second clue can be found in View Three. Students should make sure that the object detection heatmap is visible, and then should click anywhere in the red area near the front gate. This will bring up the second clue ‚Äì there was a catnip delivery by autonomous vehicle earlier in the day. It is possible that Pixel accidentally wandered into the vehicle and got taken for a ride!<br><br><br><br><br></p> |

Copy useful information over to the Activity Guide.<br><br>üîÅ <strong>Circulate:</strong> Have students explore the scene while you circulate around to help. There are two views in this scene. The computer vision technique used by the autonomous vehicle is anomaly filtering. When students click on the magnifying glass icon, a new UI element will appear on the image. It will allow the student to click a knob and shift it from the normal image, to a heatmap of common movements, to a heatmap that contains filtered anomalous movements. (5 min)<br><br>Teaching Tip<br>In this scene, the students use anomaly detection. Using computer vision along with machine learning, each view is analyzed to see the common movements of the vehicles over time. This builds up a memory of where vehicles tend to move and travel and where they do not. By filtering out the common movements, we can see anomalies. This accounts for movements that don‚Äôt normally occur‚Äì like when a random cat wanders across the scene.<br>In View Two, students can find the hidden hotspot that will reveal the clue by displaying the hotpot map of anomalous movement. The hotspot is the open door to the van. This shows that Pixel wandered from one vehicle to another, and now we need to track down this autonomous cab as it picks up passengers around the city.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Students can find Frank in View Two.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Sometimes facial recognition struggles to make sense of certain facial features and ethnic groups. Othertimes, there might be too many false positives. This is a technology with a lot of room for exploration and one which we will examine further in detail later in the module.<br><br>üí¨ <strong>Discuss:</strong> Is it ethical to use facial recognition technology to scan everyone who enters a large event?<br><br><strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Answers will vary. This conversation will foreshadow one that will be repeated several times throughout this module ‚Äì in which students will be asked to examine the ethics behind different applications of computer vision.<br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
