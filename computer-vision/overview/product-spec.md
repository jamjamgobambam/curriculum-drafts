## Problem

In today's digital age, the practical application of computer vision in K-12 computer science education remains surprisingly underexplored. This omission is both intriguing and concerning, given the meteoric rise of computer vision as a dominant subset of artificial intelligence. The field is not only experiencing rapid advancements but also finding applications in myriad sectors â€“ from health care diagnostics to augmented reality in entertainment, and from autonomous vehicles to enhanced security systems.

Computer vision holds the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and our environment. Introducing students to this transformative domain not only keeps them updated with the latest technological trends but also equips them with a foundational understanding that could significantly influence their academic trajectories, career aspirations, and their abilities to be informed citizens in an increasingly AI-driven society and to innovate in a future dominated by AI-driven solutions.

Early exposure to computer vision offers numerous advantages. For one, it prepares students for a world where interactions with AI-enhanced visual data will be commonplace. This early immersion can also stimulate interest in related STEM fields, opening doors to potential future professions in technology, research, and innovation. Additionally, by integrating real-world applications of computer vision into the curriculum, we can foster a more immersive and engaging learning environment. Such relevance in education often translates to heightened curiosity, better retention, and a deeper appreciation of the subject matter.

If we fail to prioritize computer vision in our educational agenda now, we inadvertently risk creating a generational knowledge gap. This could leave many of our students inadequately prepared to navigate, contribute to, or benefit from the imminent technological advancements. Addressing this gap is imperative for shaping informed, competent, and forward-thinking future leaders.

## Solution

We are addressing this issue by designing a comprehensive two to three week computer vision module tailored specifically for high school students, integrating both theoretical knowledge and practical application. We envision that this module starts from the basics, ensuring no student feels left behind, and gradually advancing to creating a program that incorporates a computer vision model.

While there are numerous computer vision courses available on platforms like Coursera, none are tailored specifically for the high school demographic, both in terms of complexity and application relevance. Our solution aims to fill this noticeable gap.

## Purpose

The purpose of our computer vision module is to empower high school students, irrespective of their initial inclination or proficiency in computer science, with a robust understanding and hands-on experience in the domain of computer vision. We serve both teachers seeking comprehensive guidance and students desiring relevance and depth. Our product stands unique as it is tailor-made for the high school demographic, blending foundational knowledge with interdisciplinary applications. We aspire for this module to bridge the computer science education gap, fostering a generation of innovators ready to leverage computer vision ethically and creatively to shape the future.

## Core Actions

### Teachers

* **Facilitating:** While students are experimenting and trying out tasks, teachers act as facilitators, guiding them through challenges, answering questions, and providing clarifications.
* **Evaluating Student Progress:** Teachers assess and evaluate student work, ensuring understanding and providing feedback. This action helps students know where they stand and what improvements are needed.
* **Customizing:** Depending on the class dynamics or varying levels of proficiency, teachers might need to customize the curriculum, adding supplementary materials or skipping certain sections.
* **Engaging with Ethical Discussions:** Beyond just presenting ethical considerations, teachers play a role in leading discussions, posing challenging questions, and ensuring students grasp the nuances of ethics in computer vision.
* **Creating Real-World Connections:** Teachers are often responsible for showing students the real-world implications and applications of what they learn.

### Students

* **Learning:** At its heart, the product is about imparting knowledge. Students should be able to access, understand, and internalize lessons on computer vision.
* **Experimenting:** Our curriculum thrives on students trying out computer vision tasks. Whether it's processing an image, training a basic model, or experimenting with algorithms, hands-on tasks are essential.
* **Connecting:** Our curriculum encourages students to make interdisciplinary connections. This action could involve integrating computer vision with a project in art, sports, or another subject, helping to drive home the curriculum's relevance.
* **Evaluating:** A significant portion of the learning process involves self-evaluation. Students should be able to test, debug, and refine their computer vision projects, understanding where they went right or wrong.
* **Discussing:** A collaborative environment is vital for deeper understanding. Students and teachers should be actively discussing concepts, raising queries, and brainstorming applications.
* **Reflecting on Ethics:** An action that sets our product apart might be the ethical reflections. Given the increasing importance of ethics in AI, students should be regularly analyzing and discussing the implications and biases of computer vision models and applications.

## Out of Scope

### Non-Goals

* **Advanced Professional Level Topics:** While we want to provide a comprehensive curriculum, diving into topics suitable for graduate-level or professional training in computer vision would be beyond the intended audience.
* **Integration with Unrelated Subjects:** While interdisciplinary projects are a core component, trying to integrate computer vision into every possible subject (e.g., history, physical education) could dilute the curriculum's focus.
* **Physical Kit or Hardware Distribution:** Providing physical components like cameras or specialized hardware for computer vision tasks is beyond the project's scope.

### Nice-to-Haves

* **Collaboration with Universities or Companies:** Partnerships could enhance the curriculum's quality and applicability, but they are not required for the project's initial success.
